         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Preſs is a dead thing to the Pulpit.

Wouldeſt thou know what is to be had <hi>here?</hi> If thou be ſhaken in theſe ſtaggering times, <hi>here</hi> thou maiſt ſee what a <hi>Root</hi> Chriſt is, bearing up all.

            <p>YOu are here preſented with that in Print which before you have heard Preached unto you, but I hope the impreſſion of it is not only in theſe Papers, but that it is already in your hearts; It was a glorious commendation that <hi>Paul</hi> gave of his <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, 2</hi> Epiſt. <hi>3.2.</hi> Yee are our Epiſtle written in our hearts, known and read of all men, for as much as yee are manifeſtly declared to be the
<pb facs="tcp:108127:6"/>Epiſtle of Chriſt miniſtred by us, written not with Inke, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in Tables of Stone, but in fleſhy tables of the heart.</p>
            <p>What is the end of our faithful Paſtors Preaching, and of our Hearing, but that we may be the Epiſtles of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>You have here preſented to your view ſome of the laſt words of Chriſt, wherein you have a Declaration of what he is, the Root, and the Off-ſpring of <hi>David, Davids</hi> root in regard of his Diety, and his Off-ſpring in regard of his Humanity; we have need to hear of theſe Truths again and again, eſpecially in ſuch days of Apoſtacy, and falling away from the Faith as we live in, many denying the Lord that bought them, by which wee may ſee the Scripture fulfilled, that ſaith, <hi>In the latter days many ſhall depart from the Faith;</hi> and in <hi>2 Pet. 2.1, 2.</hi> the Apoſtle plainly ſpeaks, that as there were falſe Prophets of old, ſo there ſhould be falſe Teachers that ſhould creep in, who privily ſhould bring in damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, even denying the Lord that bought them; and many ſhould follow their pernicious ways, by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhould be evil ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>You have here likewiſe a ſweet and bleſſed in vitation of the Lord Jeſus to poor thirsty Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that they would come and take of the Water of Life freely; O therefore let us not ſtand off, but come, although we have no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for little do we think what prejudice our So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:108127:7"/>Jeſus Chriſt, to receive of the things that hee hath purchaſed, and is ready to give out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; you are called out of the World, even to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>You are the Members of Chriſt, <hi>1 Corinth. 6.15.</hi> yee are the Temples of the holy Spirit, <hi>2 Cor. 6.16.</hi> you ſtand in near relation to God and Chriſt, as being his <hi>Friends,</hi> his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, his Children, his Spouſe; — Yee are his <hi>Portion,</hi> his Jewels, his peculiar Treaſure, his Vine-yard, his pleaſant Plant, his Glory, <hi>Iſa. 4.5. 1 Pet. 2.9. Yee are a choſen Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a Roval Prieſthood, a holy Nation, a peculiar People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It being thus, what flows from hence, or what doth this call for at our hands? but that we labour to ſhew forth the Praiſes of him who hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe words, <hi>I am the Root and the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of David,</hi> are a Riddle, and a ſeeming contradiction: For Chriſt to bee the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and the <hi>Off-ſpring</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> ſeems very improbable and contradictory; much like that ſpeech in the 22. of <hi>Matth.</hi> latter end, where Chriſt ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, If David call him Lord, how is he then his Son?</hi> They could not tell what to make of it; So its probable, when many read theſe words here, Chriſt is the Root of <hi>David,</hi> and the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108127:9"/>of <hi>David</hi> too, they know not how to untie this knot, and to reconcile this ſeeming contradiction; But if we plow with the Heifer of the Lord, with his Spirit, we many eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is the Root of <hi>David,</hi> as he is God, in his Divine nature; he is the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> as he is man: And in ſome ſenſe Chriſt as he is man, may be alſo the root of <hi>David;</hi> For Chriſts Humane nature was as well in <hi>Jeſſe</hi> the Father of <hi>David,</hi> as in <hi>David</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>You ſee here, Chriſt is termed a <hi>Root, I am the root of David:</hi> Of that I ſhall ſpeak at this time, and it is not in vain, that the Scripture doth ſet out Chriſt by this expreſſion (a Root) for there are ſundry reſemblances wherein the Lord Chriſt is like unto a Root.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you know a Root is a thing hidden in the earth,
<note place="margin">Wherein the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance lies between Chriſt and a Root.</note> ſecret, and not obvious to any eye; ſo the Lord Chriſt, take him eſpecially in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, that is a hidden thing. As its ſaid of God, He is the inviſible God, ſo of Chriſts Divine nature, it is an inviſible nature. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are not ſeen, ſouls are not ſeen, and God is not ſeen, and the Deity of Chriſt was not ſeen: It was hid under fleſh, under his humane nature. And Chriſts humane nature, Chriſt as man was a hidden thing? <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.10. <hi>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</hi> The world did not know him to be the Meſſiah, to be the root of <hi>David:</hi> So in <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Theſe things will they do unto you becauſe they have not known the Father, nor me; They have not known me;</hi> Chriſt was not known, but a hidden thing, a ſecret thing,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108127:9"/>like a root in the earth; as he ſaith of the Spirit in <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.17. <hi>Whom the world cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him,</hi> the world did not ſee the Spirit, nor know the Spirit; ſo the world did not ſee Chriſt, nor know Chriſt—why, Chriſts humane nature, Chriſt as man, was hidden under afflictions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reproaches, under poverty and meanneſs, and under ſcorn, and contempt, ſo that he was a root in the earth, he was a hidden thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A Root hath <hi>life</hi> in it, and the life is <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally</hi> in the root of any thing: ſo in the Lord Jeſus, there is life, and life principally in him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26. <hi>As the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> Chriſt hath life in himſelf principally and eminently as the Father had. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.4. <hi>In him was light, and that light was the life of men.</hi> In this Root was life, in Chriſt was life. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. he is ſaid to be a quickning Spirit, he hath life in him, and quickens others. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. he is <hi>The life,</hi> he is life emphatically above all others, he is a Root, he hath life principally and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in him.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Root (you know) bears up the tree, the branches, and the fruit of the tree, the Root bears up all; <hi>Thou beareſt not the root, but the root bears thee,</hi> Rom. 11. So it is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, this Root, that bears up all.</p>
            <p>Chriſt bears up the world, Chriſt bears up the Church, Chriſt bears up heaven, he bears up all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholding all things by the word of his power.</hi> The Lord Jeſus is the Root, I ſay, that bears and upholds all the whole Creation, Sion it ſelf, and Heaven it ſelf, are upheld by this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108127:10"/>Root, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but eſpecially the Church here in this world, eſpecially Sion, and the members of Sion, beleeving ſouls, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. <hi>I am the Vine,</hi> that is, I am the Root of the Vine, the Church is the Vine, and Chriſt is its Root, and he bears up the whole Vine, and all the branches, and all the cluſters upon the Vine, hee bears them up, he is the Root of the Vine, ſo that Chriſt is a Root that bears up all, he did bear up <hi>David,</hi> his family, <hi>David</hi> and his Kingdome, he bears up Sion, and all the children of Sion.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Laſtly, the Root doth convey life and ſap, and nouriſhment unto the whole body, to all the branches: ſo it is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that doth convey ſap and life, and nouriſhment unto all his body; every branch in the Vine, receives the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from the root of the Vine, and all have life from Chriſt, <hi>I am come that ye may have life,</hi> Joh. 10. all life is from Chriſt, and all light is from Chriſt, <hi>He is the morning ſtar</hi> (which we may ſpeak of afterwards) and all nouriſhment is from Chriſt, he is ſaid to be the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, and the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church is the <hi>Root</hi> of the Church in the Scripture ſenſe.</p>
            <p>And from the <hi>Head</hi> is all influence of light, and of direction, and counſel, and motion, and comfort, all is from the Head, all is from this Root.</p>
            <p>From Chriſt is conveyed all, <hi>Without me yee can do nothing;</hi> unleſs yee be in me, and have vertue from me, and derive all from me, you can do nothing.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee that Chriſt is a Root, the Root of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:108127:10"/>
            <p> But there are ſome diſparities,
<note place="margin">What diſparities there are between Chriſt and a Root.</note> or things wherein Chriſtis not like a Root.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A Root, take it in the litteral ſenſe, the roots of trees, and plants, they are of a dying nature, decaying nature, and wil grow rotten and conſume <hi>Job</hi> 14.8. <hi>Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the ſtock thereof dye in the ground;</hi> the root of a tree waxes old, and will dye and periſh, and come to nothing: but Chriſt is not like a root in that ſenſe, <hi>For Chriſt he lives for ever,</hi> Heb. 7. This Root never dyes, never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes, <hi>Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, the ſame to day, the ſame to morrow, and the ſame for ever;</hi> The Root of <hi>Sion</hi> for ever, and the Root of <hi>David</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A root doth bear but one tree, ſuffices one or two, or three bodies at moſt; the root of a Corn, it may be will ſuffice for two or three, or half a doſen ſtalks, it cannot ſuffice for all: But Chriſt is a Root that ſuffices for all, for all <hi>Sion,</hi> for the whole world, for the Church, for Heaven: Hee is the Root of <hi>David,</hi> the Root of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> the Root of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> Hee is the Root of all the Prophets, and Apoſtles, of all beleevers, of all that have ſpiritual life in them, he is the Root of them all, ſo that this Root is of another nature than thoſe roots.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Other roots are ſubject to the wills, and humors, and pleaſures of men, they can dig up the roots of things, they can burn the roots, and abuſe the roots, but Chriſt is not ſubject to the wills and humors of any, to be ſpoyled, to bee conſumed. The Scribes and Phariſees, thought to root out this Root when they put him to death, but when he was in the grave, he ſaw
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108127:11"/>no corruption, he laid down his life, and none took it from him without his leave; And he roſe again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. and mightily declared himſelf to be the Son of God, by the Spirit of holineſs; he declared himſelf to be a Root that man hath not power over: —So then you ſee for the opening of this word <hi>Root,</hi> theſe things do clear it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But here is an Objection, <hi>You ſay Chriſt is the Root of</hi> David, <hi>and the Root of all, Why had not Chriſt himſelf a Root, and was not he from a Root, and how can he be the Root of all?</hi> Iſa. 11.1. And there ſhall come forth a Rod out of the ſtem of Jeſſe, and a branch ſhal grow out of his Roots; <hi>This is meant of Christ, that Chriſt ſhould come out of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>and</hi> Jeſſe <hi>ſhould be the Root of Chriſt, and in the</hi> 10. v. <hi>it is ſaid,</hi> In that day there ſhall be a Root of Jeſſe, which ſhall ſtand for an Enſign of the people; <hi>The ſame is ſaid to be the Root of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>which is ſaid to be the</hi> ſtem or branch of Jeſſe; —<hi>How will theſe things accord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> As I anſwered before, <hi>Jeſſe</hi> is the Root of Chriſt, according to his humane nature, and Chriſt is the Root of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> according to his Divine nature; or if you will, Chriſt as Mediator was the Root of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> and of all the godly. The words being opened, I ſhall give you this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>I am the Root of David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerv. <hi>That the Lord Chriſt is the Root of Nature, the Root of Grace, and the Root of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How will that appear? why he was the Root of <hi>David</hi> as a man, the Root of <hi>David</hi> as a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108127:11"/>Saint, and the Root of <hi>David</hi> as glorified; <hi>David</hi> was now in heaven.</p>
            <p>Hee was the root of <hi>David</hi> as a man, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chriſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> root of Nature.</note> 119.73. <hi>Thy hands have made me and faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me, O Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> I did not make my ſelf, and my Parents did not make me, <hi>But thy hands have made me, and faſhioned me;</hi> Thy hand hath made me ſuch a creature, thy hand did curiouſly work me when I was in my mothers womb, that framed me, and moulded me, that ordered all my bones, and ſinews and joynts, and parts, and faculties, and the like; Thy hand hath made me, the work of nature was from him, <hi>He was the Root of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe <hi>He was the Root of Grace,
<note place="margin">Chriſt the root of Grace and Glory.</note> and the Root of Glory,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 110. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord;</hi> Why was Chriſt <hi>Davids</hi> Lord? becauſe he had given him Grace, and made him his ſervant: Why his Lord? becauſe he would give him Glory, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand:</hi> Chriſt was <hi>Davids</hi> Lord becauſe he gave him Grace, and would give him Glory: Hence it is that he ſaith in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>Grace and Glory will he give, and no good thing will hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</hi> Well, I have grace, and I ſhall have more grace, and I have a humane glory, I am a King and a Prophet, and ſhall have greater glory, I ſhall have glory in the higheſt heavens; So that you ſee its true of <hi>David, Chriſt is the root of his Nature, the root of his Grace, and the root of his Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this will appear for the general, <hi>That hee is the root of Nature, and Grace, and Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:108127:12"/>
            <p> Firſt, It will appear that Chriſt is the root of Nature,
<note place="margin">How it appears that Chriſt is the root of Nature.</note> from the Creation and making of all things; He that makes all things muſt needs bee the Lord, and the Root, and the author and fountain of Nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>By whom alſo he made the worlds,</hi> why the world was made by Chriſt, Chriſts right hand, Chriſts arm was at work in the making of all the creatures; The world was made by him, therefore he is the Lord of Nature that hath made all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It appears he is the root of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe he can blaſt nature at his pleaſure; what ſaith Chriſt to the Fig-tree? <hi>Never fruit grow more upon this tree,</hi> did it not preſently wither away? Chriſt dryed up all the moyſture, dried up the ſap, dried up the very root of the tree; why he is the very Root, and the Lord of Nature.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Farther, it appears, in regard that he hath the command of all Diſeaſes, he cured and healed them; What Diſeaſe was there ever preſented to Chriſt that he could not cure? He caſt out Devils, cured Leproſies, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſeaſes, the woman that had ſpent all her eſtate with Phyſitians, and could do no good; the man that lay at the Pool of <hi>Betheſday,</hi> and could not be cured, yet Chriſt cures all Diſeaſes; <hi>He is the root of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, So likewiſe it appears from his raiſing of the dead; when men are upon diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and nature going downward, the breaths gone, the ſoul is gone, the body putrified, it matters not ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Martha, Thou ſhalt ſee the glory of God,</hi> thou ſhalt ſee that I am the root of Nature, that I am the root of all, that I can call both the ſoul, and breathe breath into him,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108127:12"/>and raiſe him up; Theſe are evidences that hee is the Root and Lord of Nature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt hee is the root of Grace,
<note place="margin">Chriſt the root of Grace.</note> all Grace is from him, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel, To preach it to the poor, he hath ſent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the Captives, and recovering of ſight to the blind, to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord:</hi> Is not here Grace in all theſe? Yes, and all comes from Chriſt, Hee was annointed with the Spirit of the Lord to do theſe things. And more fully in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14, 16, 17. <hi>The word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us, full of Grace and Truth;</hi> but for whom was this Grace, and for whom was the Truth? ſaith <hi>John, And of his fulneſs have all we received, and Grace for Grace;</hi> Hee had a fulneſs of Grace, hee was the Author, the Root of Grace, the Fountain of Grace, the God of Grace, and this Grace was to be communicated, and derived unto others, <hi>Of his fulneſs have we all received Grace for Grace: For the Law was given by Moſes, but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Lord Chriſt is the root of Grace. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21. <hi>Where ſin abounded, Grace did much more abound, That as ſin hath reigned unto death, even ſo might Grace reign through righteouſneſs unto eternal life by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> Sin abounded, I but Grace doth ſuperabound; how comes it to ſuperabound? <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> Grace muſt reign, as ſin hath reigned, and it muſt reign by Chriſt, this Grace will ſend out ſo much Grace, that Grace
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108127:13"/>will reign, and out-reign ſin, bring under ſin; So then Chriſt he is the root of Grace.</p>
            <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">Chriſt the roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Glory.</note> Chriſt he is the root of Glory, there is none let into heaven but by Chriſt, none made glorious, but by Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. he is called the <hi>Lord of Glory, They crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord of Glory, becauſe he was a glorious Lord in himſelf; The Lord of Glory, becauſe he hath all Glory to diſpoſe of: The Lord of Glory, becauſe he advances whom he pleaſes to Glory, he will advance his Church unto Glory, all beleevers unto Glory; So that you ſee now, <hi>Chriſt he is the root of Nature, the root of Grace, and the root of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what remains, but that we ſhould make ſome uſe of this point, and there are ſeveral things which will be obſervable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> Firſt, If Chriſt be the <hi>Root of Nature, of Grace, and Glory,</hi> then we may all make uſe of that which <hi>David</hi> doth upon this account, in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 138.8. <hi>Thy mercy, O Lord, indures for ever, forſake not the works of thine own hand;</hi> why, may not every one ſay, Lord I am the work of thy hands, thou haſt made me a creature, Thou art the root of my nature? Lord, do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me, but Lord make me gracious, as well as to have nature; bee the root not only of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life to mee, but the root of a ſpriritual life unto me, and be the root of Glory unto me; why thy hand hath made me; Thou haſt made me a man, given me an immortal ſoul, indued me with underſtanding, and ſome wiſdome and knowledge, Lord do not forſake me, leave mee not to the Devil, to the world, to my ſelf;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108127:13"/>But Lord, ſeeing thy hand hath made me a man, ſo Lord let it make me a new man; as I have a Natural life, ſo let me have another life, a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life; ſo every one when they are in ſtraights and troubles, in darkneſs and afflictions, and think they are left of God, and Chriſt, let them uſe this Argument in Prayer, I am the work of thine hands, what wilt thou leave the work of thy own hands? why men will not deſert the work of their own hands, thou haſt not deſerted the Creation, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, Night and day, Summer and Winter; why Lord, I am the work of thine own hands, do not leave me, nor forſake me.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Is Chriſt the root of Nature, of Grace, and of Glory? then whatſoever difference you ſee in men as men, in men as Chriſtians, what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſoever you read of men in glory, it is all from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it is from the root. You know that one Tree is higher than another, it is from the root; that one tree or branch is higher, or bigger than another, it is from the root of the Tree; that the differences are in the branches, and arms, and boughes of the tree, it is all from the root of the tree; ſo the differences that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, it is from the root. Chriſt he gives unto one man great parts, to another man leſſer parts; he gives unto one man a ſtrong judgement, a ſtrong memory, admirable Elocution, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man he gives not the ſame, the difference is in Chriſt, he is the root of Nature, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates what he pleaſe. So likewiſe the talents of Grace, he gives to one man one talent, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man two talents, to another man five talents, the Lord is the root, and he makes one higher than
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108127:14"/>another; ſome men have choyſe Gifts, and Graces, ſome one man hath more than ten other men have; it may be another man is beneath him in a degree or two, ſome are beneath a great deal; in Grace, ſome are Babes, ſome Children, ſome Young-men, ſome old Diſciples.</p>
            <p>So in Glory, the twelve Apoſtles ſhall ſit upon twelve Thrones; in glory, ſome are like the Sun, ſome like the Moon, ſome like the Stars; where is the difference? the difference lies in the root, he communicates what he pleaſes, both in Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, in Spirituals, and in Glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If Chriſt be the root, then let us not bee high-minded, let none be lifted up with whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever injoyments they have; whatſoever gifts you have, whatſoever Graces you have, what Glory ſoever you look for, bee not lifted up, and the reaſon is plain here, and ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.18. <hi>Boaſt not againſt the Branches;</hi> Why, another man is a Branch as well as thou art, take man as man, he is a Branch in the Tree of Nature, and wilt thou boaſt thy ſelf againſt him? boaſt not of thy wit, or beauty, or ſtrength, or any Natural abilities thou haſt, for thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee.</p>
            <p>So, boaſt not of Spirituals, that you have ſo much faith, ſo much knowledge, ſo much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, humility, and love, do not boaſt of theſe things, Chriſt is the root, and the root bears thee.</p>
            <p>So, do not boaſt of what places you ſhall have in Heaven; the Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> they would bee at the right hand, and at the left hand of Chriſt, when they came into his Kingdom; they would have ſuch and ſuch places, but know, the root
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108127:14"/>bears thee, be therefore humble and lowly, what thou haſt thou haſt received, why art thou lifted up then, as if thou hadſt not received it? the root, the Lord Chriſt will call you to an account one day of what you have received, and how you have imployed the ſame; therefore remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thou haſt all from the root, and nothing of thine own.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If Chriſt be the Root that bears up all, bee the root of Nature, Grace, and Glory, then let us fear to offend and provoke him; if a mans life, habitation, and maintenance depended upon ſome one man, would he not take heed how he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked that man? doth not your <hi>All</hi> depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this root Chriſt, your Nature depends upon him? in him you live, and move, and have your beings, — your habitations and maintenance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon him.</p>
            <p>So for your Spiritual life, and Spiritual good, doth it not depend upon this Root? Is not hee the Root of Life, of all Spiritual life, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and bleſſings? Is not hee the root from whom you receive all Grace, all truth, and all comforts and good?</p>
            <p>Do you not look through him to have your glory? why will you offend him now, and ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? O what a root is this that bears up all Nature, that bears up all Grace, and all Glory, and bears up all the Spiritual good of men and women, the root that bears up Heaven, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and all! take heed I ſay, of trampling upon this root, of wronging Chriſt, of ſlighting Chriſt, of grieving Chriſt, of diſpleaſing him any way, if he with-draw influences of nature, dye you muſt preſently; — if he with-draw influences of Grace,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108127:15"/>in darkneſs you muſt ſit preſently; — if he ſhould with-draw Glory from you, where would you bee but without doors?</p>
            <p n="5">5 Again, If Chriſt bee the root of Nature, Grace, and Glory, then let us make it our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſerve and honour him; is it not the duty of a Childe, coming from the loyns of his Parents, to ſerve them, and honour them? ſo it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of every man, ſeeing Chriſt is the root of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, it is the duty of every man to ſerve the Lord — ſerve him with thine Eyes, ſerve him with thy Tongue, ſerve him with thy Hand, ſerve him with thy Foot, ſerve him with thy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſerve him with thy Will, ſerve him with thine Affections, ſerve him with the whole Man, for thou haſt all from him as a man, let all then return to him; Waters that come from the Sea run back again to the Sea, and ſeeing wee all come from Chriſt, who is God, and the root of Nature, let us then work in order, and ſerve him.</p>
            <p>But much more you that are Spiritual; hath Chriſt given you life, Spiritual life, quickned you when you were dead in ſins and trepſpaſſes? Is Chriſt the root of all your Spiritual good and welfare? will you not ſerve Chriſt? what, will you be for the World, for Hell, and for Sin now? why Chriſt is your root, are you then his Vine, and will not live to Chriſt? certainly we ſhould ſerve Chriſt, and honour Chriſt upon this account — and we would do it if we did well conſider, why I have my life of Faith, and of Grace, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and I hope for Glory hereafter from Chriſt, and ſhall I not ſerve the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? I look for glory, therefore I will purifie my ſelf as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108127:15"/>he is pure; Chriſt in you the hope of Glory, is he your root, and have you hope of Glory? then puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie your ſelves as he is pure; yea ſerve Chriſt with pure hearts, and pure affections, and pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, live to the Lord Jeſus, he is the root of Nature, the root of Spiritual life, and the root of Glory.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Again, if Chriſt be the root of all, then here you may know what your conditions are, what ſtate you are in; tell me what root you are roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon, what root do you grow on; do you grow upon the old <hi>Adam</hi> ſtill, or are you rooted upon Chriſt? If old <hi>Adam</hi> be your root, as hee is the root of Man-kind, of corrupt man, if you grow upon that root, you are no more than when you came into the World, your fruit is ſour, your Grapes are wild Crapes, your Natures are corrupt, you are enemies to God, you are upon the root of bitterneſs, a root of death.</p>
            <p>Nay, let me ſay, Are you upon Chriſt now, as he is God only, for Chriſt is the root of Nature as he is God, if you be rooted upon Chriſt as hee is God only, as he hath made you, if you be no more than this, you have marred your ſelves ſince he made you, therefore make inquiry whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you be rooted upon Chriſt as Mediator, as the root of <hi>David,</hi> as God-man, whether you have intereſt in Chriſt upon that account, and if it be, your fruit is good fruit, fruit becoming the Goſpel, fruit worthy of Grace, and worthy of a man that is called, juſtified, and ſanctified; other fruit you bare, now you bear ſuch fruit as Chriſt did; thoſe that are tranſlated, and cut off from the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and ingrafted into Chriſt, they bear other fruit than before; therefore inquire
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108127:16"/>what root you are upon, whether you are rooted into Chriſt, yea or no, that will yeeld a great deal of comfort unto you, if it be ſo.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Further, If Chriſt be the Root of Nature, the Root of Grace, and the Root of Glory, and of all, then this is great comfort unto every true Chriſtian; why he is planted in Chriſt, and hee ſhall never dry nor wither away; in the 1 Pſal: he ſpeaks there of a Tree planted by the water ſide, that bringeth forth his fruit in his ſeaſon, his leaf alſo ſhall not wither — why, he that is a true Chriſtian, that is intrinſically ingrafted into Chriſt, he is in ſuch a root that hath life, water of life, and vertue, and is communicating conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually unto the branches: <hi>I am come</hi> (in the tenth of <hi>John</hi>) <hi>that you may have life, and that yee may have it more abundantly:</hi> If thou be truly in Chriſt thou ſhalt have life, and have it more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, thou art in a River of Water, thou art in a root that hath abundance of all Spiritual good, and Spiritual Bleſſings for you, therefore look to it that you be in Chriſt, and then you ſhall have vertue in him, your root ſhall never wither, it ſhall never decay.</p>
            <p n="8">8 If Chriſt bee the Root of all, then bee exhorted every one to get intereſt in this Root, get intereſt in him, and then your natures will be ſanctified, get intereſt in him, and then you will have of all the fulneſs of Chriſt, and you ſhall have of all his glory: Men and Women they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be rooted in the World, to be rooted in Sin, O how are men rooted in ſin, rooted in wicked practices! how are they rooted in worldly things, and ſo intangled and fixt that there is no getting of them off, or out from the World! what
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108127:16"/>ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 7. ſaith he, <hi>rooted and built up in Chriſt.</hi> O <hi>be rooted,</hi> ſaith hee, but where? in Chriſt; it is good to be rooted in Chriſt, O labour to be rooted in him, rooted in the love of Chriſt, in the power of Chriſt, in the Merits of Chriſt, in the Interceſſion of Chriſt; O labour to be rooted in theſe, and then you will grow — And the way to bee rooted in theſe is double; there are but two things that I ſhall name, and they are principall things —</p>
            <p>The Firſt is by Faith, and the Second by Love:</p>
            <p>Get faith in Chriſt, that unites you to him, and the more faith, the more rooted in him, and get further and further into Chriſt; labour for faith and that will fix you, ſettle, and eſtabliſh you in Chriſt; it is our want of faith that makes us ſo off and on with God, and with Chriſt, and ſuch poor Creatures as we are; well, labour for faith, and that is a drawing Vertue, a drawing Grace, it will draw from Chriſt whatſoever is to bee had in him.</p>
            <p>And then love the Lord Jeſus; where there is love, how doth it root a man in the heart of a man or woman? ſo if you love the Lord Jeſus more, you will be rooted more in him, that is the way to be rooted in Chriſt, get faith, and get love.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Laſtly, If Chriſt be the root of Reaſon, the root of Grace, and Glory, the root of all, then let us give the glory and praiſe of all to Jeſus Chriſt, and attribute nothing to our ſelves or others. We are wonderful apt, when wee ſee a Tree full of fruit, to attribute it to the Tree, O it is a very good Tree, you look not to the root, you attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108127:17"/>nothing to that, whereas it is the root you ſhould attribute it to; ſo now we attribute this to our ſelves, our own endeavours, labours, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, and diligence, but wee look not at the Root, we look not at Chriſt who is the Root of Nature; wee look not at Chriſt who is the Root of Grace; we look not at Chriſt who is the Root of Glory; and therefore ſee the reaſon why we are ſo little in thankfulneſs, becauſe wee have ſo little faith; But if we had more faith now to ſee the root, we ſhould be more thankful; the root is a hidden thing, Chriſt is in Heaven, and Chriſts Divine Nature was hidden, and becauſe we ſee not Chriſt as God, ſee not Chriſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, look not at Chriſt as all in all, therefore we give not that glory to him, but wee look at ſecond Cauſes, Meanes, Ordinances, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Parents, Friends, and the like; and ſo God and Chriſt loſe their Glory, and their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but if you would look at the root, and ſay, O this comes from Chriſt, this comes from God, this comes from the Mediator, from his Grace, yea all comes from him, O then your hearts would be carried out to ſpeak of, and to glorifie his name.</p>
            <p>Well, look at Chriſt, for you have nothing but from him; therefore not to me, nor to others, but unto thee alone O Lord be all the glory.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> There be ſeveral Grounds or Reaſons for it;</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>David</hi> was he that founded the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there began the foundation of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Iſrael; Saul</hi> was the firſt King, but <hi>Saul</hi> was given in wrath, and rejected of God, and therefore it is not called the Kingdom of <hi>Saul,</hi> and the reckoning is not from <hi>Saul,</hi> but it is called the Kingdom of <hi>David,</hi> and the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is from <hi>David;</hi> ſo that he was a moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and a known perſon in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Ought yee not to know, That the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>gave the Kingdom over</hi> Iſrael <hi>to</hi> David <hi>our Father for ever, even to him, and to his Sons by a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Salt?</hi> God gave the Kingdom to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> was the moſt eminent King; and the Founder of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here <hi>David</hi> is rather mentioned; he is the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> the Founder of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>David</hi> was the moſt lively Type of Jeſus Chriſt of any in the whole Scripture, and therefore he is named the Off-ſpring of <hi>David</hi> rather than any others; <hi>David</hi> was beloved of God, ſo his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108127:18"/>name ſignifies; and <hi>David</hi> you know ſlew the Bear, and the Lion, and reſerved the Sheep, and the Lamb from them; <hi>David</hi> killed <hi>Goliah</hi> and freed the whole Army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from him, — <hi>David</hi> was a gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t Warrier &amp; a great Conqueror, and got famous Victories; <hi>David</hi> brought back the Ark of God — <hi>David</hi> was a man indured great afflictions after he was annoynted King, for many years together, before hee came to the Throne, and to the Kingdom; <hi>David</hi> likewiſe was a Prophet, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. is a Pſalm wherein <hi>David</hi> is ſet out fully to be a type of Chriſt all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long that Pſalm.</p>
            <p>So Chriſt, he was the beloved of God, and Chriſt he delivered the Lambs from the Bear and the Lion, Chriſt he ſlew <hi>Goliah,</hi> he led Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity captive, the Lord Chriſt obtained great Victories over the World, Sin; and Sathan, and all our Spiritual enemies; the Lord Chriſt brought back the Ark, the truths of God that were in darkneſs, and hid, he brought immortality and Life to light again.</p>
            <p>The Lord indured here in this World a great deal of miſery before hee came to glory, and therefore he is ſaid to be the Off-ſpring of <hi>David</hi> rather than any other.</p>
            <p n="3">3 But laſtly, For anſwer to this, The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy was that Meſſiah ſhould be the Son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> God had promiſed <hi>David,</hi> That out of his loyns Chriſt ſhould come, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.15. <hi>But my mercy ſhall not depart away from him, as I took it from</hi> Saul, <hi>whom I put away before thee: And thine Houſe and thy Kingdom ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever before thee, thy Throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever.</hi> Mark, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108127:19"/>him a Throne that ſhould be eſtabliſhed for ever, he muſt have a ſeed then, and that God ſwears unto him concerning it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.35, 36. <hi>Once have I ſworn by my holineſs, That I will not lie unto</hi> David, <hi>his ſeed ſhall indure for ever, and his Throne as the Sun before me.</hi> This is ſpoken of Chriſt the Seed; and the Scripture ſaith, That of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> Meſſiah ſhould come: Now though the promiſe were made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that Chriſt ſhould come of his ſeed, and he is ſaid to be the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> —yet <hi>David</hi> is put firſt, becauſe the Promiſe was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made to <hi>David</hi> than to <hi>Abraham;</hi> therefore the eyes of the Jews were upon that promiſe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any other: Hence you find that it was ordinary and common in their mouths, To look at Chriſt the Son of <hi>David, Matth.</hi> 15.22. <hi>A woman of</hi> Canaan <hi>came out of the ſame coaſt, and cryed unto him ſaying, have mercy upon me O Lord thou Son of</hi> David, and <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.30. <hi>And behold two blind men ſitting by the way ſide, when they heard that Jeſus paſſed by, cryed out ſaying, have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of</hi> David; And chap. 21.9. <hi>And the multitude that went before, and that followed after, cried, ſaying, Hoſanna to the Son of</hi> David; even all ſorts looked at Meſſiah to be the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and the Off-ſpring of <hi>David;</hi> Hence is it that rather <hi>David</hi> is named here than others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But if Chriſt be the Son of <hi>David,</hi> It may be ſaid by way of Objection from that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.8. <hi>And who ſhall declare his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If Chriſt be the Son of</hi> David, <hi>every one may declare his Generation therefore how do
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108127:19"/>theſe two Scriptures then correſpond?</hi> Who ſhall declare his generation, <hi>ſaith</hi> Iſaiah? <hi>Now</hi> Matthew <hi>and</hi> John <hi>tell his Generation, that he is the Son of</hi> David, <hi>and the Off-spring of</hi> David?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For anſwer, Firſt of all know, That ſome Expoſitors, and not without cauſe, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to Chriſts divine Nature and generation of God, and who can declare his Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration? that is, who can declare how the Father begot the Son, how Chriſt from all eternity ſhould be a Son: let that man ariſe, and ſet his gifts and graces a work to the uttermoſt as he can, and ſhew the Generation of Chriſt, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal generation; it is beyond the comprehenſion of men or Angels, therefore I ſay ſome Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors refer it to that, and ſo, who can tell his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration?</p>
            <p n="2">2 It may be referred to Chriſts days and years that he was for to live and continue, after his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, for he ſpeaks in this Chapter of Chriſt as man, and ſuffering, and ſaith he, here in the verſe, <hi>Who ſhall declare his Generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living; Who ſhall declare his Generation?</hi> That is, the continuance of his days and time; for they thought that when he was cut off, there had been an end of his daies; but there was not an end of Chriſts days, for though his humane nature were laid in the grave, yet there was a root under that, <hi>the Divine Nature,</hi> and he was raiſed again, and Chriſt he lives for ever. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore: —Who ſhall declare his Generation?</hi> Who ſhall declare the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108127:20"/>days and years that Chriſt now ſhall live, he lives for ever, he lives for evermore; who ſhall declare his Generation?</p>
            <p>Or Thirdly, And that which I conceive to be more full yet, <hi>Who ſhall declare his Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> that is, The off-ſpring that ſhall come of him; for we ſay this is the Generation of ſuch a man, theſe are his poſterity: <hi>Who ſhall declare his Generation?</hi> that is, Who ſhall declare his ſeed, his children, thoſe that ſhall be his; for the Lord Chriſt he hath a ſeed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Behold I and the children which thou haſt given me,</hi> Chriſt had children, he had an Off ſpring, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. he is called the <hi>Everlaſting Father;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath children, children in all ages, and in all Generations; and Chriſts Generation did exceed declaring; who ſhall declare his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>Act.</hi> 21.20. <hi>Thou ſeeſt, brother how many thouſands of Jews there are which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve:</hi> How many ten thouſands, as the word ſignifies in the original, many millions, and <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. There was ſealed out of every Tribe twelve thouſand, an hundred forty and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. —And in verſ. 9. <hi>After this I beheld, and loe a great multitude which no man could number of all nations,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he hath a Seed, he hath a Generation, a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity that cannot be numbered; a Generation that cannot be declared how many they are; ſo that this hinders nothing, nor contradicts what is delivered here, That he is the Off-ſpring of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words being thus opened, I ſhall draw forth ſome Concluſions from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> The firſt Concluſion is this, That if Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108127:20"/>Chriſt be the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> then Chriſt was and is true man; and this is, or ought to be an Article of your Faith, To know the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be true man. You know the Off-ſpring of any thing is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing from whence it comes; The Off-ſet, or the Off-ſpring of the tree, is of the ſame nature with the tree; So now, if Chriſt be the off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> he muſt be of the ſame nature with <hi>David,</hi> elſe he could not be his Off-ſpring: If <hi>David</hi> therefore were a true man, had fleſh and blood, and ſpirit, and bones, ſo muſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with him.</p>
            <p>Some have denied Chriſt to be Man, as well as ſome have denied him to be God, (and I may trouble you with the Authors, but I forbear that) I ſay, ſome have denied him to be man, but he was the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> and the Scripture is plain enough for it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The word was made fleſh (Fleſh) and dwelt among us;</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Foraſmuch then, as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf took part of the ſame,</hi> he was fleſh and blood as we are, and therefore he is called man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one Mediator between God and man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>—He was ſubject to the ſame infirmities that we are, (I do not mean ſinfull infirmities, but natural infirmities) ſubject to the ſame temptations: he was ſubject to hunger, and thirſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>old, and heat, to wearineſs, and ſleep (and the like.) He was true Man, not a man imaginary or notional, but a real true Man; Hence ſaith Chriſt in <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. when they ſaid, behold a Spirit, no ſaith he, touch me,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108127:21"/>handle me, I have fleſh, I have bones, which is more than any ſpirit hath. And it was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould be true Man (not to trouble you with all the Arguments that might be given you upon that account, but) upon theſe two grounds.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That he might have the right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; Man was fallen, and man needed a Redeemer, and had not Chriſt been man, he had not had the right of Redemption, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.25: <hi>If thy Brother be waxen poor, and hath ſold away ſome of his poſſeſſion, and if any of his Kin come to redeem it, then ſhall he redeem that which his Brother hath ſold,</hi> &amp;c. Well, we had loſt our poſſeſſion, loſt our ſelves, and now if we have any Brother that can come to redeem us, it is his right, but we had none, and were not able to redeem our ſelves; we had no friend, no brother that could do it for us, onely Jeſus Chriſt comes, and becomes Man, takes fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bone, and ſo the right of redemption belonged to him, and therefore he was man, that he might have the right of Redemption.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt muſt needs be true man, that ſo he might be capable of dying for us, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering our enemies, of ſatisfying the Law and Juſtice, and obtaining ſuch mercies as we ſtood in need of; it was needful hee ſhould bee man, that ſo hee might be capable of death, &amp;c. Heb. 2.14. <hi>For as much then as the Children are partakers of fleſh and bloud, he alſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame, that through death hee might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil.</hi> Had not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108127:21"/>Chriſt been true Man he could not have dyed, and had not he dyed, he could not have deſtroyed him that had the power of Death, the Devil; but ſaith he, He was partaker of fleſh and bloud, that through death hee might deſtroy him that had the power of death; that is, the Devil. So that Chriſt muſt needs be true Man that he might dye, and deſtroy the Devil, who had the power of death.</p>
            <p>And he muſt needs be true Man and dye, that ſo he might ſatisfie the Law and Juſtice of God. <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thou ſhalt dye the death;</hi> thou thy ſelf, or thy Surety for thee, now one of the ſame nature muſt dye. The Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken by Man. Man muſt dye to ſatisfie the Law, and to ſatisfie Juſtice, and man muſt dye to obtain remiſſion of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Without ſhedding of bloud there is no remiſſion.</hi> Had not Chriſt been true Man, and had bloud in him as we have, and that bloud ſhed too, there had been no remiſſion of ſins, no purchaſing of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance for us, as in verſ. 12. <hi>Neither by the bloud of Goats and Calves, but by his own bloud he entred in once into the holy place, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained eternal Redemption for us;</hi> ſo that it was neceſſary Chriſt ſhould be of the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> true Man, that hee might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Death, ſatisfie Law and Juſtice, and obtain Remiſſion and eternal Redemption for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> Now this ſerves for our comfort, and for our comfort two ways.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Chriſt being true Man is ſenſible of our miſeries, of our in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmities, of our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and of our temptations; had he not been
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108127:22"/>Man, he had not known what weakneſs means, what hunger and thirſt means, what death and temptations mean, but being true Man, the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> he knew as well as <hi>David,</hi> or any that were of the ſeed of <hi>David;</hi> hee knew what infirmities and weakneſs meant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behooved him to bee made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Prieſt, &amp;</hi> ver. 18. <hi>For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> The Lord Chriſt is ſenſible of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, when therefore <hi>Saul</hi> did perſecute the Church of God; ſaith he, <hi>Saul, Saul, why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteſt thou me?</hi> I am of their fleſh, and of their bloud, and of their Nature, and I feel the blows that they have; This now is ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to us, that the Lord Jeſus, the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> ſits in Heaven, and is ſenſible of our temptations, of our weakneſſes, and frailties.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is matter of comfort to us in regard of this, That we may with boldneſs and confidence now go to God having Chriſt who is of our Nature ſtanding between God and us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Wee have not an High Prieſt which cannot bee touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as wee are, yet without ſin; Let us therefore come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and finde grace to help in time of need.</hi> Do you need Grace and Mercy? Do you need pardon of Sin, and Grace againſt Corruption? then you may go with boldneſs to the Throne of Grace; why Chriſt is at the Throne of Grace, Chriſt who is the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> Chriſt who is of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108127:22"/>your Nature, Chriſt who is ſenſible of your wants, he is there; go and tell the Lord Jeſus what Temptations you have, what Corruptions you have, what guilt you finde, what weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes you finde in you; go and tell the Lord Jeſus, and deſire him to commend it to the Father, and he will do it for you.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The next Concluſion here is, If Chriſt be of the Race of <hi>David,</hi> that the Lord Jeſus is no mean Perſon, but a very honourable Perſon, and well deſcended, he is the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>David</hi> a Prophet, of <hi>David</hi> a King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of <hi>David</hi> the beloved of God, of <hi>David,</hi> an eminent Perſon in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Chriſt is well born, and well deſcended, he is of the Bloud Royal; <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. <hi>Where is he that is born King of Iſrael,</hi> hee deſcended from Kings, from the greateſt that the Scripture mentions. It was <hi>Solomons</hi> honour to be the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and it is the honour of Chriſt to be the Son of <hi>David; Behold, a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than</hi> Solomon <hi>is here</hi> — And there be two expreſſions upon this very account which do help to ſet out the Lord Chriſt, that he is a perſon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable indeed.</p>
            <p>The one is, That he is called the <hi>Branch;</hi> ſo in <hi>Iſa.</hi> and <hi>Jerem.</hi> and <hi>Zach.</hi> hee is called the <hi>Branch,</hi> that is, the branch out of this Root, the branch of <hi>David,</hi> an eminent and glorious branch, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.15. <hi>In thoſe days, and at that time will I cauſe the branch of righteouſneſs to grow up unto</hi> David, <hi>and hee ſhall execute Judgement and Righteouſneſs in the Land; David</hi> he is the Root, out of that Root ſhall come the Off-ſpring, Chriſt, the Branch of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, the righteous Branch, or the Branch
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108127:23"/>that acts and works Righteouſneſs, that executes Judgement and Juſtice, a Branch that yeelds the beſt Fruit that ever the World had; a Branch of Righteouſneſs, and ſuch a Branch, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.2. <hi>In that day ſhall the Branch of the Lord bee beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth ſhall be excellent and comely.</hi> This is the Branch of <hi>David,</hi> and is called, <hi>The Branch of the Lord,</hi> and this Branch ſhall be beautiful and glorious, beautiful and glorious all the World o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the fruit of the Earth ſhall bee excellent and comely: O here is a Branch of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, here is a Branch out of a Root, the Lord Chriſt out of the Root of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> the Root of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> that ſhall yeeld fruit which ſhall be excellent all the World over.</p>
            <p>The other expreſſion is that in <hi>Ezeck.</hi> 24.29. where he is called, <hi>The Plant of renown.</hi> This Branch, this Plant, this Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> is the <hi>Plant of renown.</hi> There have been many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Plants in the World, <hi>Abraham</hi> was a renowned Plant in his days, ſo <hi>Joſhua, Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets were renowned Plants, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were renowned Plants alſo. But Chriſt is the Plant of renown empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically; this Plant hath done renowned things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this is the Plant that is to bee honoured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the Plants that ever were in the World, he hath done ſuch things as never any did; this is he that took away the ſin of the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. This is he that did break down the partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wall between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and reconciled <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> Epheſ. 2.11, 12, 13, 14. This is he that laid the foundation of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and built up that, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.12.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108127:23"/>
               <hi>And ſpeak unto him, ſaying, Behold, thus ſpeaketh the Lord of Hoſts, ſaying, behold the man whoſe name is the</hi> Branch, <hi>and hee ſhall grow up ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of his place, and he ſhall build the Temple of the Lord:</hi> It is the Branch, the Branch, the Plant of renown, the Lord Jeſus, the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> that ſhall build the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church — This is he that brought in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.22. to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, and to ſeal up the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion — this is the Plant that yeelds ſuch fruit as this, as to ſend the Comforter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7. this is he that did ſuch Works as never any did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.24. ſo that the Lord Chriſt he is no mean perſon, he is the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> the Branch of Righteouſneſs, the Plant of Renown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> This ſerves in the firſt place to take off the offence and prejudice which lies in the hearts of many againſt Chriſt in regard of his meaneneſs, in regard of his poverty: in regard of his being accounted the Carpenters Son, a Fellow, and a vulgar Perſon, and in that he was reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Malefactors, and put to an open ſhameful Death; many ſtumble at theſe things! the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtumble, and the <hi>Turks</hi> ſtumble, and ſay, Our Saviour was a poor contemptible man, and the like; but this may take off all the prejudice and ſcandal that ariſes thence, he was the Son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the Branch of renown, hee that did ſuch things as never man did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. ſaith Chriſt, Bleſſed is he that is not offended at me, why I am a poor Man, that have not two Coates, that have not a houſe to hide my head in, that have not bread to eat (and the like) and bleſſed is he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108127:24"/>that is not offended at me, that ſtumbles not at my meanneſs, nor at the ſcandals and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that are taken at me; O bleſſed is he that is not offended at me, but can look through theſe, and can ſee me to be the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> the Plant of Renown, the Branch of Righteouſneſs, that can ſee me to be all in all.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This may ſerve to ſtrengthen our faith; many did reject <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 22.7. <hi>Then</hi> Saul <hi>ſaid unto his Servants that ſtood about him, here now yee</hi> Benjamites, <hi>will the Son of</hi> Jeſſe <hi>give every one of you Fields and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards? &amp;c.</hi> he rejects the Son of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> that is, <hi>David</hi> himſelf, what hath this poor fellow ſuch and ſuch things to give you, he is but the Son of <hi>Jeſſe?</hi> So many reject Jeſus the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and ſay, Why what hath this poor Jeſus to give you, he was but the Carpenters Son? but this ſerves to ſtrengthen our faith, <hi>Wee know,</hi> ſaith Paul, <hi>in whom we have beleeved;</hi> we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in him who is the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> the Plant of renown, the Branch of renown, that took away the ſin of the World, that ſends the Comforter, that can do greater things for us than we can ask, or think; we beleeve in him who is an honourable Perſon, deſcended from the beſt Bloud that ever was, we beleeve in him.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This ſhould ſerve to raiſe up our hearts to a higher eſteem of the Lord Jeſus; Kings Sons are regarded and obſerved by all the people; the Lord Jeſus was a Kings Son, the Son of <hi>David,</hi> I, and the Son of God too, therefore we ſhould have high and honourable thoughts of the Lord Jeſus, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>To you that beleeve hee is precious,</hi> precious in your thoughts, precious in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108127:24"/>your deſires; a beleeving Soul ſees what an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Perſon Chriſt is, Carnal eyes do not ſee, but Spiritual eyes do ſee this Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> they ſee what a Plant he is, what a Branch he is — And it ſhould make men and women deſirous to come in to Chriſt, and cloſe with Chriſt. Women deſire honourable Matches, and rich Matches, and ſhall not our Souls now cloſe with Chriſt, who is the beſt Match? the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> the Heir of the World, the Heir of Heaven; O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let your deſires be towards Chriſt, and cloſe with the Lord Jeſus, and honour him in your thoughts, and exalt him in your hearts, and lift him up higher and higher every day: for there is none like unto him.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Laſtly, This may ſerve to let us ſee, what ſervice and ſubjection is due unto Jeſus Chriſt; hee is the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> hee is the Root of <hi>David,</hi> he is God, and he is true Man, and he is of the moſt eminent of men in the World, therefore all ſervice and ſubjection is due unto him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Kiſs the Son leſt he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The next Concluſion to be drawn from theſe words is this, If Chriſt bee the Root and Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> then whatſoever the Scripture faith upon this account, and conſideration, muſt be made good; and there are two Scriptures worthy your ſerious and beſt conſideration —</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:108127:25"/>
            <p> The firſt is, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Behold, the days come ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe unto</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>a righteous branch, and a King ſhall reign and proſper, and ſhall execute Juſtice and Judgement in the earth.</hi> Hear what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith of the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> he ſhall be a King, and ſhall proſper, and he ſhall execute Juſtice and Judgement in the earth. — The other Scripture is in <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.29. <hi>He ſhall be Great, and ſhall be called the Son of the Higheſt, and the Lord ſhall give unto him the Throne of his Father David.</hi> Whether ever Chriſt yet had theſe Scriptures made good unto him is worth your ſerious conſideration; was Chriſt ever yet ſet upon the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> according to theſe words? When Chriſt was here, it was in a ſtate of Humiliation, he came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter unto others, and he did waſh his Diſciples feet, he was in a ſtate of humiliation; doth it not remain then that theſe Scriptures ſhould be made good? It is true, Chriſt hath a Throne in Heaven, but that is not <hi>Davids</hi> Throne, that is the Throne of God, but he ſhall ſit upon his Father <hi>Davids</hi> Throne. And ſurely there is ſomething in that, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.11. <hi>And I ſaw heaven opened, and behold a white Horſe, and he that ſate upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteouſneſs he doth judge and make Warre, his eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many Crowns, and hee had a name written that no man knew but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and he was cloathed in a veſture dipt in bloud, and his name was called the Word of God;</hi> who was this but Chriſt? <hi>And the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which were in Heaven followed him upon
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108127:25"/>white Horſes, cloathed in fine Linnen, white and clean, and out of his mouth goeth a ſharp Sword, that with it he ſhould ſmite the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and he ſhall rule them with a rod of Iron, and he treadeth the Wine-preſs of the fiercè<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wrath of Almighty God, &amp;c.</hi> Whether this bee yet fulfilled take into your ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; and this concluſion, that Chriſt the Off-ſpring of <hi>David</hi> muſt reign, and ſit upon the Throne or <hi>David,</hi> ſerves for two ſpeciall things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt For preparation.</item>
               <item>Secondly, For expectation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt for Preparation, That people ſhould prepare and ſit themſelves againſt the coming of Chriſt, ſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Let us be glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and give honour to him, for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her ſelf ready.</hi> This was in Viſion, now it muſt be made good in reality; let every Soul prepare and make themſelves ready for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Lord Jeſus; you know a Bride doth trim and deck up her ſelf, and put on her orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and make her ſelf as lovely and amiable as poſſibly the can; ſo ſhould every Soul purge away ſin, and deck up themſelves with the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods Spirit, and walk righteouſly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, and unblamably, and ſo make themſelves ready for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Second is for Expectation, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I am the Root, and the Off-ſpring of</hi> David; and what follows in the next words? <hi>And the Spirit, and the Bride ſaith, come and let him that heareth, ſay, come, &amp;c.</hi> preſently ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is an expectation raiſed; Chriſt ſpeaks theſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108127:26"/>words to raiſe the expectations of all that ſhould live after this Book, to expect his coming, I am the root of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> the root of <hi>David,</hi> and the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> I have upheld <hi>David,</hi> and he hath had a Kingdom, and I am his Son, and I muſt come, and I muſt ſit upon his Throne, and I muſt reign.</p>
            <p>The next Concluſion is this, That the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt under theſe Notions, or expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here, is of great concernment.—This is the laſt Declaration that ever the Lord Jeſus made of himſelf here in the world, and what ſaith he? <hi>I am the root, and the off-ſpring of David;</hi> and ſo leaves it unto the World to conſider of. This is of great concernment to conſider Chriſt under theſe Notions — now to make it out in two or three particulars —</p>
            <p n="1">1 Here is held out unto us the two Natures of Chriſt, his God-head his Divine Nature, and his Human Nature, the Divine Nature, <hi>I am the root of David,</hi> his Human nature, <hi>The off-ſpring of</hi> David, and withall a great Myſtery; for mark, I am the root of <hi>David,</hi> and the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> lyes between both: So here, Chriſts Human nature in the Off-ſpring, the Divine nature in the root, and Chriſt Mediator lyes between both; for there muſt be a concurrence of Divine and Human nature to imperſonate Chriſt to be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; which here is held out unto the World, in the laſt Declaration of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I am God, and I uphold you, I uphold <hi>David</hi> and his Kingdom, and I am the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> I am ſenſible of any thing is done to my Church and People, and I am Mediator, and will mediate with my Father for vengeance on thoſe ſhal wrong
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108127:26"/>them, and for aſſiſtance of all thoſe he hath given unto me.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Herein many Scriptures are fulfilled, <hi>I am the root and Off-ſpring of David;</hi> and ſo wee may ſee the truth, reality, and certainty of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Hath not the Scripture ſaid, that Chriſt cometh of the Seed of</hi> David, <hi>and out of the town of</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>where</hi> David <hi>was?</hi> The Scripture hath ſaid it, and ſaid it often in thoſe places I named, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. &amp; 132.11. and in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.30. hee ſeeing this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſpake of the Reſurrection of Chriſt; now theſe and many other places, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Mich.</hi> 5.2. All theſe places are fulfilled in this word, <hi>I am the Off ſpring of David;</hi> Chriſt bears witneſs here to the end of the world, that the Scriptures are fulfilled and made good, and that the Scripture is certain and true, and you may build upon it, for in him all Scriptures are fulfilled; therefore let none pull away the Scriptures from you, let none adde or diminiſh, but look to the Scriptures, build upon them, for I am the Sum of them, and in me they are accompliſht, <hi>I am the Off-ſpring of</hi> David.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The knowledge of Chriſt under this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of great concernment, in that here you may ſee in what near relation the Lord Chriſt ſtands in unto all Saints, and unto all Beleevers, he is the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> then he muſt needs be a King, he muſt needs be brother to all the Seed of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> for as it was ſaid of <hi>Abraham</hi> being the Father of Chriſt, that he was the Father of all the faithful; ſo is it implyed of <hi>David,</hi> being the Father of Chriſt, he is the Father of all the faithful; and <hi>David</hi> hath a numerous ſeed, <hi>Jer,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:108127:27"/>33.22. As the Hoſt of Heaven cannot be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, neither the ſand of the Sea meaſured, ſo will I multiply the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> my Servant. This hath reference to what God promiſed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> That he would multiply his Seed as the ſand of the Sea; <hi>David</hi> hath a numerous Seed, I do not mean his ſeed in the Fleſh, but his ſeed in the Spirit; godly Beleevers are the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> and ſo they are the Kindred of Chriſt, and Chriſt is Brother to them all— And will you ſee yet a more full place? <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.11, 12. For both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified are both of one, for which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them Brethren, ſaying, <hi>I will declare thy name unto my Brethren, in the midst of the Church will I ſing praiſe unto thee;</hi> They are all of one, of one God, ſay ſome, of one <hi>Abraham</hi> ſay others: and why not of one <hi>David?</hi> for this Scripture refers to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in the next Verſe, and both Chriſt was of <hi>David,</hi> and all that are ſanctified are the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>I will declare thy name unto my Brethren;</hi> now in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. wherein <hi>David</hi> was a type of them, verſ. 22. <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleare thy name unto my brethren, in the midſt of the Congregation,</hi> ſo that both Chriſt who ſanctifies, and thoſe who are ſanctified, are of one, of one God, of one <hi>Abraham,</hi> of one <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and of one Chriſt too, and Chriſt is their Brother, and ſo there is a near relation between Chriſt and the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> ſo that every godly one may ſay, Chriſt is my Brother, and God is my Father; and this is ſtrong conſolation to the hearts of men and women. We may have one Concluſion more from the words, and that is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108127:27"/>this — That the Lord doth honour the memory of the righteous, the righteous and godly are not forgotten of God, but they are in honour with God, and Chriſt, <hi>I am the Off-ſpring of</hi> David, ſaith he: Chriſt makes honourable mention here of <hi>David,</hi> ſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. there <hi>David</hi> is brought in with honourable mention, ſo that you ſee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled what is written, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.6. <hi>The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall bee in everlaſting remembrance; David</hi> is in everlaſting remembrance, and ſo all righteous perſons ſhall be had in everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.6. <hi>The memory of the juſt is bleſſed, but the name of the wicked ſhall rot. Davids</hi> name here was bleſſed, Chriſt honours it, <hi>I am the Off-ſpring of</hi> David; and the name of the wicked rots, if they be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it is with diſgrace; <hi>Jeroboam that made Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to ſin,</hi> his name ſtinks; <hi>Iudas Iſcariot,</hi> Judas <hi>that betrayed Chriſt;</hi> ſo wicked men, though they may ſet up their Monuments, and have their Tombs, as they are moſt forward uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that way, their names ſtink, rot, and decay, but the name of the righteous ſhall be had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Come now to theſe words. Chriſt tells you here that he is a bright and a morning Star— in Scripture he is called <hi>a Light,</hi> Joh. 1.5. a <hi>great Light,</hi> Iſa. 9.2. <hi>The light of the Gentiles,</hi> Iſa. 42.6. <hi>A Star,</hi> Numb. 24.17.— <hi>A Day Star,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.19. and here, <hi>A bright and a morning Star</hi> —</p>
            <p>The Spirit of God delights in this Metaphor, in ſetting out Chriſt by a Light, and by a Star —</p>
            <p>Some here by this bright and morning Star do underſtand the Divine Nature of Chriſt, his Dei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, which is bright, glorious, and ſhining, and ſo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. that Nature is ſaid to be the brightneſs of his Fathers glory, but the Scripture ſeems rather to point at his Human Nature, than the Divine Nature, for it is ſaid, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.17. <hi>A Star ſhall come forth of Jacob,</hi> noting his Deſcent from <hi>Jacob</hi> the Patriarch, and ſo his Human Nature; and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.2, 9. a Star appeared at the Incarnation and birth of Chriſt, which Star did not out, that this was the Star
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108127:28"/>that came out of <hi>Jacob;</hi> Chriſt now born, the Star did inſinuate unto us that Chriſt which was now born was the Star — But wee may take in both Natures, his Divine and Human, and ſo here Chriſt himſelf doth, <hi>I am the root of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> as he was God; and the Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> as he was Man; <hi>And I am the bright and morning Star,</hi> the bright Star as God, the morning Star as Man, riſen from Man.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhew you here, Firſt, In what reſpect Chriſt is ſaid to be the bright and morning Star, the reſemblances that lye upon that account—I ſhall anſwer an Objection, and a Queſtion, and make Application.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt,
<note place="margin">The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance between Chriſt and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Star.</note> That Chriſt is compared to a bright and a morning Star.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe the Stars they are without dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Chriſt is never compared to the Moon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Moon hath ſpots; but he is compared to the Stars that have no darkneſs, nor dimneſs in them; and Chriſt he had no darkneſs, no ſin in him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.5. <hi>In him was light, and there was no darkneſs;</hi> there was no ſin in Chriſt, no poſſibility of ſinning in Chriſt; <hi>Adam</hi> in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency had a power to ſin, and he did ſin, but Chriſt had a power not to ſin, and he cannot ſin; the Stars have a power to fall, but Chriſt hath no power to fall, Chriſt he is without ſin, without guile, the Devil himſelf could not finde the leaſt ſin in him, any thing of his in him; now upon this account Chriſt is a bright and a morning Star, without darkneſs, without ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Stars do ſparkle and caſt forth their beams, if you look wiſtly upon them you may ſee how they ſparkle, and ſend out their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108127:29"/>beams, whereby they do diſpel darkneſs; ſo Chriſt having hid in him all the treaſures of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Knowledge, he doth ſparkle and ſend out his beams of Light, whereby he doth diſpel darkneſs, and herein he is like to the Stars; now Chriſt he ſparkles and expels darkneſs by his Doctrin — by his Miracles — and by his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
            <p>Firſt in his Doctrin, the Lord Chriſt had the Spirit above meaſure, and was full of Wiſdom, full of Grace, full of Knowledge, and hee gives out Divine truths, ſparkling truths, truths that are very glorious, he gave out the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Leſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> the Goſpel is glorious, and full of light, and it ſhines, why it is the Goſpel of Chriſt, and in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.8. <hi>The darkneſs is paſt, and the true Light now ſhines.</hi> Chriſt is the <hi>true</hi> Light, and he gave out the true Light, the Goſpel; and ſaith he, <hi>the darkneſs is paſt;</hi> that is, diſpelled and driven away, and the true Light ſhines. Chriſt is a Star now upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that he ſparkles in his Doctrin, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels darkneſs — Chriſt doth diſpel the darkneſs of ignorance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.16. <hi>The people which ſate in darkneſs ſaw a great light;</hi> when Chriſt came they ſaw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>en the darkneſs of ignorance, and now this Star ſcattered the darkneſs, and they ſaw a great light — Hee ſcatters the darkneſs of wickedneſs, of malice, of corruption, and ſin in the hearts of men and women, and in their lives, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.11. <hi>And have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them.</hi> Here is light now brought to ſcatter the darkneſs of wickedneſs, and of ſin — He ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108127:29"/>the darkneſs of death, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.29. <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in peace accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy Word, for mine eyes have ſeen thy Salvation,</hi> ſaith old <hi>Simeon.</hi> Now I fear no death, nor the darkneſs of death, <hi>Mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation.</hi> Chriſt he came, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Salvation, and the Conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the darkneſs of death was no darkneſs unto <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> — He ſcatters the darkneſs of Afflictions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>For our light afflictions which is but for a moment, worketh for us a farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> While we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things that are not ſeen; when we look at Chriſt, and the glory of Chriſt, afflictions are no affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions unto us; ſo in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. for as the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abounds by Chriſt, afflictions are no affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions where this Light comes, where this Star ſhineth; ſo that Chriſt he gives in his Doctrin, and expels darkneſs; Chriſts Doctrin is a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Doctrin, <hi>He ſhall convince men of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgement</hi> — ſo in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. there he convinc'd them, &amp; ſtop'd their mouthes, <hi>Give unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſars, and unto God the things that are Gods;</hi> and they were all amazed at his Doctrin, and Wiſdom — Chriſts light it was a diſtinguiſhing light, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, except a man be born again he cannot enter into the Kingdom of heaven;</hi> ſo in <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. <hi>If</hi> Abraham <hi>were your Father, you would do the works of</hi> Abraham, <hi>but you are of your Father the Devil, and his luſts you will do.</hi> It is diſtinguiſhing Light — His Doctrin is quickning and converting, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108127:30"/>
               <hi>The words that I ſpeak are ſpirit, and life</hi> — His Doctrin is a comforting Doctrin, full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conſolation; why, this Star doth ſparkle in the Goſpel, and there is abundance of glory and light therein; ſo that Chriſt he is a Star up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account.</p>
            <p>So Secondly in his Miracles, how did this Star ſparkle there, and fill the world with glory and light there? <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Jeſus went about all Galilee teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom, and healing all manner of ſickneſs, and all manner of diſeaſe among the people, and his ſame went throughout all</hi> Syria, <hi>and they brought unto him all ſick people, &amp;c.</hi> His fame went through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Galilee,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and all the Countries round about. And in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. the Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> comes to him, and he healed her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and verſ. 30, 31. <hi>Great multitudes came unto him, having with them thoſe that were Iame, blinde, dumb, maimed, and many others, and caſt them down at Jeſus feet, and he healed them, inſomuch that the multitude wondred when they ſaw the dumb to ſpeak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk and the blinde to ſee, and they glorified the God of Iſrael.</hi> Here is the Lord Chriſt now ſparkling in his power and Miracles, and ſhewed himſelf to be a bright morning Star, to be God indeed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt ſparkles in his Converſation; O how did this morning Star ſparkle there!</p>
            <p n="1">1 In his Humility; how did hee ſhine there? in the thirteenth of <hi>John,</hi> Chriſt waſhes his Diſciples feet, and wipes them, when hee had done, Go (ſaith he) and do as I have done, I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108127:30"/>that am your Lord and Maſter, I have humbled my ſelf to ſet you down, and to waſh your feet, and to wipe them with a towel, here is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Humility for you, go and do as I have done.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In his Meekneſs, and Patience; O how patient was Chriſt when they wronged him, and abuſed him every way? <hi>He was dumb as a ſheep before the Shearer, and opened not his mouth,</hi> Matth. 11.29. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 He ſparkled in his Self-denial; when they came to make him a King, he would be no King, he refuſed Honour, and Greatneſs, and Glory; when they would have trumpeted his Fame, hee forbad them, and commanded them ſilence, and to ſay nothing; when they would have him to have divided the Inheritance among the Brethren, he would not, but denies himſelf, yea he denied his own greatneſs in heaven.</p>
            <p n="4">4 So likewiſe in his Obedience; There he was a ſparkling Star indeed, never ſuch obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as the obedience of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>Hee humbled himſelf to the death of the Croſs,</hi> hee bare our infirmities, he bare our ſins, he bare the wrath of God, he was made an open ſhame and ſcorn; O never ſuch Humility as was in Chriſt, he humbled himſelf to obey things contrary to fleſh and bloud; who would have obeyed as Chriſt obeyed? when he had power in his hand, and could have commanded twelve Legions of Angels, yet he obeys unto death?</p>
            <p n="5">5 So Chriſt, he ſparkles in his love to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; was there ever ſuch love as Chriſt ſhews to the World? Gods Love is ſet out with a <hi>So
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108127:31"/>he loved the world,</hi> and ſo hath Chriſt loved the world, ſo as to dye for it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>He hath loved us, and waſhed us in his own bloud;</hi> Did ever any Mother love the Childe ſo, as to waſh it in her own bloud? Did there ever any Prince love his People ſo, as to waſh them in his own bloud? But Chriſt hath ſo loved us, as to ſhed his bloud, and to waſh us in his own bloud; he hath ſo loved us as he hath laid down his life for us, and thought nothing too dear to part with, nothing too hard to ſuffer on our account.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Chriſt likewiſe ſparkled in his pity and compaſſion towards the people, when they came to hear him; Chriſt was full of compaſſion, and would not let them go away hungry leſt they ſhould faint by the way. Chriſt in the nineteenth of <hi>Luke</hi> weeps over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Chriſt wept o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinners that would not weep for themſelves: Chriſt ſparkled in all theſe, and in many other paſſages of his life; and ſo you ſee that he is a Star indeed, in ſparkling and letting out his beams, and diſpelling darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The morning Star is the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Star (one of them) in all the Heavens, a chief Star; ſo Chriſt is the chiefeſt Star, the Star of the firſt Magnitude; there is not a more glorious Star in the Heavens than the morning Star, and not a more glorious one than Chriſt. In 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.17. Princes and great ones are called eminent Stars, or Lights, Thou ſhalt go no more out with us to Battel, that thou quench not the light of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> why <hi>David</hi> was a Star of the greateſt magnitude in all <hi>Iſrael</hi>— and ſo <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charib,</hi> or <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> or both of them, they are ſaid to be Lucifer, the Son of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108127:31"/>
               <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.12. that is, a chief Star, yet a <hi>falling</hi> ſtar; but now Chriſt is a Star which is moſt eminent, there is no ſtar among the Sons of Men, no Man, no Angel that is equal to Chriſt, but he is above them, he is of a higher magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.2. <hi>He is fairer than the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men;</hi> he hath more beauty, more glory, more Majeſty, more greatneſs than any of the Children of men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Hee is Prince of the Kings of the earth;</hi> take the Kings of the Earth that are ſtars, and great ſtars, yet Chriſt is the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, ſo that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account he is a bright and a morning Star, he goes beyond all the ſtars, and all the lights in the World, and all the Lights in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Stars you know have their influences, and let down their influences here upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; In <hi>Job</hi> there is mention made of Pleiades, the ſeven ſtars, and <hi>Oryon,</hi> and the reſt that ſend down their influences, and the morning ſtar hath its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as well as other ſtars; ſo the Lord Chriſt, he is not wanting this way, but lets out his influences; Chriſt is ſaid to have the ſeven Spirits, the ſeven Stars, and lets out all the Graces and vertues of his Spirit, <hi>Of his fulneſs we receive grace for grace;</hi> and he ſends the Comforter, he is the head, and hath influence into the whole body. This Star lets out vertue into all the inferiour Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are belonging unto him, ſo that the Lord Chriſt he is a bright morning Star upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Chriſt is a bright and morning Star, eſpecially in that the morning Star brings notice of good tidings, that the day is at hand, when the morning Star is up then the day is near; ſo
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108127:32"/>Chriſt, hee hath brought good tidings that the day is at hand, and that the night is paſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. At the Incarnation of Chriſt the Angel ſaid, <hi>Fear not, for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the City of David, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> And what then? Verſ. 14. <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> Now the night of Gods anger was paſt, and the day of Gods favour was coming, he brought back the Sun of Gods favour, and fatherly goodneſs, and love unto us; ſo in <hi>Luke</hi> 1.76, 77. <hi>Thou ſhalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways, to give knowledge of Salvation to his people by the remiſſion of their ſins, through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring from on high hath viſited us, to give light unto them which ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</hi> So that here is good tidings come, now the day is at hand, and Chriſt hath brought immortality and life again into the world, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. which are now made manifeſt by the appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who hath aboliſhed death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel—and eſpecially the morning Star in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great day that is a coming, which ſome call the Day of Judgement, and others call the Day of Reſtitution of all things, there is a great Day a coming — Chriſt is the bright mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Star, that doth fore-run the great Day, of which you hear in <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.9. <hi>And the Lord ſhall be King over all the earth, in that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108127:32"/>day ſhall there be one Lord, and his name one;</hi> this bright morning Star is the fore-runner of that day; in that day this bright morning Star ſhall be a Sun, and verſ. 20, 21. <hi>In that day ſhall there be upon the bells of the horſes, holineſs to the Lord, and the Pots in the Lords Houſe ſhall be like the Bowls before the Altar, yea every pot in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and in</hi> Judah, <hi>ſhall bee holineſs to the Lord of Hoſts, and all they that ſacrifice ſhall come and take of them, and ſeeth therein; and in that day there ſhall be no more the Canaanite in the houſe of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> There is a great day a coming wherein there ſhall be no more the Canaanite in the Houſe of the Lord, and <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. <hi>Behold, the day cometh that ſhall burn as an Oven, &amp;c. but unto you that fear my name ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe, with healing in his wings.</hi> There is a day a coming, a great day, which this Day-ſtar is the fore-runner of, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>Looking for, and hastening unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the Heavens beeing on fire ſhall bee diſſolved, and the Element ſhall melt with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent heat.</hi> He is a bright morning Star in regard he goes before that day which ſhall come. Thus you ſee upon what account, and in what ſenſe Chriſt is reſembled to a bright morning Star.</p>
            <p>Now an Objection we have to anſwer, which is this:</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>Are not Saints Stars, and Angels Stars, and Morning Stars too? Is this any great matter in that Chriſt is called a Star, and a morning Star? In</hi> Gen. 37.9. Joſeph <hi>in his Dream there ſaith, I</hi> beheld the Sun, and the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108127:33"/>Moon, and the eleaven Stars made obeyſance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; <hi>that was his Brethren. And in</hi> Job 38 7. When the Morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for joy; <hi>that is interpreted of the Angels who are called mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Stars, ſo that if Saints be Stars, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels morning Stars, is it any ſuch matter that Chriſt is here called a bright and a morning Star? and it is ſaid of</hi> John <hi>likewiſe, that hee was a burning and a ſhining light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſo.</hi> It is granted Saints are Stars, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are Stars, and they may bee morning Stars too, and yet this doth not at all diſadvantage Chriſts being here a bright and morning Star; for,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Theſe Stars, their light is Derivative, it is derived from Chriſt, and derived from God, both what Angels have, and what the Saints have it is borrowed; the Angels are the Creatures of God, and of Chriſt, they made the Angels, and ſo they had their light whatſoever it is from them — And the Saints, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Yee were darkneſs, but now are yee light in the Lord;</hi> they have their light from the Lord, from Chriſt, and from God, ſo that this is no diſadvantage unto Chriſt, Chriſts light it is eſſential unto him, it is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived light.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Their light is diminutive, a little light, it is Candle light, they do underſtand little to what Chriſt doth, <hi>In him are all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge, in him is all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God;</hi> which is not ſo in any of theſe; theſe Stars, the Brethren of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> had but a little light, and Angels have but little light to God, and Chriſt; What is the light of a Torch
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108127:33"/>to the light of the Sun? ſuch is the light of theſe to the light of God, and Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The light of theſe is dependent light; If God and Chriſt with-draw their influences a little, how dark are they? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. The Angels ſtand hearkening what God will ſay to them, they do not know what to do, but God muſt give them out a word of command, and give them light, and they depend upon him for light; and ſo all the Saints depend upon God and Chriſt for light, and if God do but with-draw his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, how dark are Saints and Angels; ſo that you ſee the light of theſe is no way deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the light of Chriſt, hee is a bright and a morning Star.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But now a Queſtion here; If Chriſt be a bright and a morning Star, why do ſo few follow the light of this Star, and ſo many follow Sathan who is the Prince of darkneſs, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, who is darkneſs it ſelf?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The only and great Anſwer to this, is, becauſe men are darkneſs themſelves, and love darkneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light leſh his deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> And in verſ. 19. <hi>Men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil;</hi> they love darkneſs, they hate light, and love darkneſs, if men hate light they care not for the light of Chriſt, that is, convincing light, reproving light, condemning light; now they hate the light, and they love darkneſs; and if the Devil and Antichriſt turn themſelves into Angels of Light ſometimes, yet that light is but darkneſs, and they love that darkneſs, they love Deluſions, love Errors, love Hereſies, and Lyes, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108127:34"/>becauſe men receive not the truth with the love of it, therefore God ſends them ſtrong deluſions, and gives them up to beleeve the lyes of Sathan, and the lyes of Antichriſt, that pretend light, but they are lyes, and they are darkneſs: no marvel then that they follow the Beaſt, and follow Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and follow the World, and run the contrary way. Thus you ſee the Point opened.</p>
            <p n="1">1 If Chriſt be a bright and morning Star,
<note place="margin">Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</note> then ſurely it is evil, and their end will be fearful and dreadful that will not follow after light, but go on in ſin, and works of darkneſs; whereas the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry riſing of this Star, and ſhining of this Star, was to diſpel darkneſs, and to ſhew unto men the way they ſhould walk in, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>The grace of God that bringeth Salvation hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all men;</hi> this Star is riſen, hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the whole World, full of grace; And to what end hath it appeared? <hi>To bring Salvation, and to teach men to deny ungodlineſs and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi> Now if men will not ſee this light, but will live ungodly, unrighteouſly, unjuſtly, wickedly; If men will follow the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the World, then they refuſe this light, and what will be the iſſue of it? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is hid to them that are loſt.</hi> If they will not ſee this light now that is ſo bright, the Goſpel is hid, and Chriſt is hid, and the Star is in a Cloud, and the Devil hath caſt a miſt before their eyes, and before their mindes, and they are loſt and undone Creatures; and in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>This is the Condemnation,</hi> this will be the Condemnation, <hi>That light is come into the world,</hi> the morning Star is up, the glorious
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108127:34"/>Goſpel is gotten out, but men love darkneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than light, they love Sin, they love Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, they love Sathan, they love their Luſts; and is it not a grievous thing that this Star ſhould ſhine among us which the <hi>Jews</hi> have not? and we ſhould be worſe than <hi>Jews,</hi> that Heathens have not &amp; we ſhould be worſe than Heathens for Drunkenneſs, for Swearing, for deceiving, and for defrauding one another, and for all manner of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; O this will be the Condemnation, It will be eaſier for <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> that have not the Goſpel, neither own it, han for Chriſtians that have this light, this bright morning Star ſhining among them, and walk not after it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If Chriſt be a bright and a morning Star, then let us all look unto this Star for light, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; It is not good to be in the dark, if you have but a little light in the dark you account it a great matter; this World is full of darkneſs, now let us look to this Star, and the light of this Star — You that are Mariners, when you are at Sea, if you can ſee but a Star, eſpecially the Pole-Star, you think it a great priviledge, and know where you are, and how to ſteer your courſe, and to avoyd Sands, and Rocks, and dangers; this World is a ſea of trouble, a ſea of ſin, and of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and wil you not look to this Pole-Star? If you will look to this Star, this bright and morning Star, you will ſayl ſafely, you will avoyd Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, you will avoyd the loſing of your Souls, which is the greateſt loſs of all. O look to this Star to direct you, and to guide you over the ſea of this World, that you may go ſafely to the Haven of Happineſs, if you ſayl not by this Star you will never get to Heaven; It is not ſayling by your own Luſts, your own Wills, Humours, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108127:35"/>fancies, and to live as you pleaſe; If you will not live according to the light that hee hath given you out, you are undone Creatures, look to it; wee are all ſailing either down to Hell, or towards Heaven; well, let us take our directions from this bright and morning Star, and wee ſhall never ſail the wrong way.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If Chriſt bee the bright and morning Star, then hee is worthy to bee admired and worthy to bee magnified, who is a Star of the higheſt Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, who is the chiefeſt Star in Heaven; you ſtand looking ſometimes upon a Star, and gazing upon the Sun or Moon, and admire them for their glory, and beauty, and ſparkling, and the like; well, here is a Star for you to look upon and to admire. The Heathens did ſo admire the Stars, that they did worſhip them for Gods, and did ſacrifice unto them; that you are not to do; but here is a ſtar for you to admire, to adore, and to ſacrifice unto; I mean to offer praiſes unto this bright and morning Star, even the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. The Lord hath ſet him up that wee ſhould honour him as wee honour the Father, to praiſe and magnifie him for the Light hee hath brought, for the great things hee hath wrought for us; I herefore mind this Star, and admire this Star, hee will come to bee admired in all his Saints hereafter, hee ſhould bee admired now, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. <hi>praiſe him all yee Stars of Light,</hi> Are you Stars? and are you Stars of Light? are you godly and gracious? praiſe him, even this Star, all you Stars of Light; O bleſſe God for Chriſt, and magnifie Chriſt, and lift up the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and praiſe of Jeſus Chriſt, for hee is worthy, hee is above all Princes and Potentates, above all
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108127:35"/>Angels, hee is the bright and morning Star.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Is Chriſt the morning Star? then examine whether this day-Star (as <hi>Peter</hi> calls him) bee riſen in your hearts, the Stars may bee up in the Heavens, but whether is this Star riſen in your hearts? and for diſcovery of that, I ſhall give you a few things whereby you may know whether this bright morning Star bee riſen in your hearts.</p>
            <p n="1">1 You know the Light is a pleaſant thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. to if Chriſt bee riſen in your hearts, then the Light of Chriſt will bee a pleaſant thing to your minds, to your ſouls: The Light is a thing that doth greatly pleaſe and rejoyce; what delight then have you in this Star? what delight have you in the Goſpel? Is the Goſpel, and the Light of it welcome to your hearts, pleaſing to your ſouls, glad tydings to you? the Word of God was to <hi>Job</hi> and to <hi>David</hi> as meat, and their appointed food, as hony and the hony combe; more than thouſands of gold and ſilver. And the more bright the Light is, the more pleaſing and delightfull; dim Light doth not ſo much pleaſe as a clear Light; the ſhaddows, and types, and ceremonies of the Law, they had ſome Light in them, but it was a dim Light, but now all theſe ſhaddows and darkneſſe hath Chriſt taken away, and the Light now appears clearly, is this welcome now to your hearts? can you ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.140. <hi>Thy Word is very pure, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy Servant loves it.</hi> O Lord thy Word is clear Light, there is no darkneſſe in it, therefore doth thy Servant love it; do you love the Light? others hate the Light, becauſe their deeds are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; but do you love the Light? is it welcome to you though it do reprove you, and condemn
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108127:36"/>your Light, and the more it condemns and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, the more acceptable it is? O! this is an Argument the day Star is riſen in your hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Where this Light is riſen, there it doth work a transformation, it transforms all where this day Star doth riſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>And bee not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the World, but bee yee transformed by the renowing of your minds;</hi> why, what Light is it that doth transform us by the renewing of our minds? it is not the light of Nature doth it, nor the Light of any Creature: but it is the Light of Life doth it; and there is no Light of Life, but this Light that Chriſt brings, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.12. Chriſt ſpeaks there <hi>that hee is the Light of the World,</hi> and it is called, <hi>the Light of Life;</hi> It is Light that will make you a New-Creature, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in the mind, being transformed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of your mind, the Mind will be altered, and the Will will bee altered, and the whole Man will bee altered, and there will bee an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall change wrought in the Man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>But wee all with open face beholding as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image,</hi> Wee behold in the Goſpel, that is the glaſs, This bright morning Star ariſes in the Goſpel, and wee behold his glory and his Light there; and what then? are changed into the ſame Image, even from glory to glory, ſo that it is a transforming Light, you were darkneſs in your ſelves, but now are you Light in the Lord; the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians</hi> that were darkneſſe were changed into Light, into the very Light of the Lord; ſo that there is a transforming of us, and a changing of us into the very Light of Chriſt, ſo that wee become Stars, and have that very Light, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, we
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108127:36"/>have the minde of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Where this bright and morning Star is riſen, there will be love to all thoſe that have the ſame light in them, to all thoſe that are Chriſts, to all beleevers, to all the godly, to all are brethren, there will be love unto them all; ſee a place for this purpoſe, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>The dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is paſt, and the true light now ſhineth, he that ſaith he is in the light,</hi> mark, <hi>and hateth his brother, is in darkneſs even untill now.</hi> Why, many will ſay they are in the light, and this Day-ſtar is riſen in them, <hi>He that ſaith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkneſs, but he that loveth his brother abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the light, and there is none occaſion of ſtumbling in him; but he that hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in darkneſs, and walketh in darkneſs, and knoweth not whither he goeth, becauſe that darkneſs hath blinded his eyes.</hi> Is Chriſt the Day-ſtar riſen in that mans heart who hates his Brother? No, he is in darkneſs, and knows not what hee doth, nor whither hee goes. Do you love a godly man, do you love your brother, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cannot indure him that hath light in him, their ways are not as our ways, their lives are not as our lives, O then light will convince, light doth reprove, and light will reprove the unfruitful works of darkneſs; well, if you have light in you, you will love the brethren.</p>
            <p>I, the Brethren, but who are they? Theſe are Hypocrites, and if they had light, and Chriſt were in them, we ſhould love them.</p>
            <p>Well, will you know who is a Brother, turn to <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. ult. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall do the will of my Father which is in Heaven, the ſame
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108127:37"/>is my brother.</hi> Whoſoever will do the Will of God, the ſame is a Brother, a Brother to Chriſt, and to all the Brethren of Chriſt; <hi>I go to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to your Father, and I have called you brethren.</hi> That man that endeavours moſt to do the Will of God, that man hath light, and that man hath life; when men ſwear, and lye, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their luſts, and courſes of the world, they are darkneſs, and walk in darkneſs, but that man that walks moſt conformable to the rule of Gods Word, he is light, he is a brother, but if you have not love, the Day-ſtar is not riſen in your hearts.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Laſtly, If this Day-ſtar be riſen in you, then you will follow the Lord Chriſt, and the Light that he holds out unto you, and others you will not follow; I ſay, you will follow Chriſt, hee is Light, ſaith <hi>Paul, Be yee followers of me as I am of Chriſt, and my Sheep know my voyce, and they follow me, but they know not the voyce of ſtrangers, and will not follow them.</hi> Chriſts Sheep, thoſe that have light, they will follow the light, they will follow the Day-ſtar; you know that when they were in the Wilderneſs they had a Pillar of Fire went before them in the night, and they followed that; ſo now, Chriſt is the Pillar of Fire, he is the Star that goes before them, and they will follow that Star; the Wiſe men had a Star that went before them, and they followed that Star, and that led them to Chriſt; but now we muſt not follow Stars, nor follow Men, but follow Chriſt <hi>the Star;</hi> whom do you follow now? your own wiſdom, your own counſel, your own Iuſts, the examples of men, and the like; are theſe your Guides and Leaders? you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done

            <p n="5">5 If Chriſt be the bright and morning Star; then let us look, and wait for the Day which this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Star is a fore-runner of, it will be a glorious and a great Day, be it the Day of Judgement, as ſome do conceive, or the day of Reſtitution of all things, as others conceive, yet that day will come, and it will be a remarkable day, a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous day, a day of burning, a day of fire, a day to conſume the wicked, a day to advance and raiſe the godly; and <hi>Paul</hi> doth beſeech them, in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> (he lays the weight upon that very thing) chap. 2. verſ. 1. <hi>Now we beſeech you Brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by our gathering together unto him.</hi> O the coming of Chriſt is a very weighty thing, when he ſhall come in the glory of his Father, and of the Angels, to judge the World, or to deliver the World, it will bee a great day, a ſeparating day; O therefore let us look for that day, and prepare for it; Oh, the Saints at that day will have cauſe to lift up their heads, their Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion draweth nigh — It will be the day wherein Chriſt, as he ſaith, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.29. <hi>I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of the Vine, untill the day when I drink it new with you in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Kingdom;</hi> It will be a day of rejoycing to the Saints, but the wicked ſhall have a Cup of Vinegar to drink, or mingled Cup with Wrath, and they muſt drink it all off to their undoing: well, ſeeing the morning Star hath appeared, and is up, and that day will come, O let us look and prepare for it.</p>

            <p n="3">3 A Bride, ſhe hath her Ornaments and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els about her, ſhe is trim'd, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.10. ſo the Church hath Ornaments and Jewels about her, ſhe is trimmed and deckt with the Graces of the Spirit, with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. White Linnen (in the <hi>Revelation</hi>) is ſaid to bee the righteouſneſs of Saints, the Church hath her Ornaments, her Jewels, and Graces, <hi>Canticles</hi> 4.9.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Laſtly, The Bride you know expects Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of ſuch a Perſon; ſo the Church looks to be married unto Chriſt, ſhe waites for the day, ſhe is eſpouſed already, and waites for to be married unto the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. ſo then you ſee upon what account the Church is called a Bride.</p>
            <p>Now the Point to be handled is this.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That both the Spirit of God, and the whole Church are deſirous of Chriſts coming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Spirit and the Bride ſay, come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſpeak a little to the Spirit of God; the Spirit of God is ſaid in Scripture to intercede for us — and the Spirit of God luſts againſt the fleſh — and here the Spirit deſires the coming of Chriſt; <hi>The Spirit ſaith, come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Spirit deſires the coming of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Why the Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the coming of Chriſt.</note> becauſe it having received from Chriſt all truth, and having given it out unto Apoſtles, and unto <hi>John,</hi> and ſo to the Church, it would gladly have the Church ſee the accompliſhment of what is given out by the Spirit, which will not all bee done till the coming of Chriſt; all truth will not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108127:40"/>be accompliſhed, Propheſies, or Promiſes will not be fulfilled till the coming of Chriſt, and the Spirit having received of Chriſt, and given them out, the Spirit deſires the accompliſhment of them, that the Church might ſee it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Spirrt deſires Chriſts coming, for the honour of Chriſt; it is ſaid in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. Chriſt ſhall come to be admired, this ſhall bee the honour of Chriſt to bee admired by the Church to be admired by the World, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he ſhall bee admired of the Saints, and of thoſe that do beleeve; and the more admirable will Chriſt be when they ſhall ſee all Truths ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and made good, that he gave out by his Spirit. It is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.26. <hi>God is a God that confirmeth the word of his Servant, and performeth the counſel of his Meſſengers;</hi> ſo Chriſt, he will confirm the word of his Spirit, and confirm the word of his Meſſenger; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit brought it from Chriſt to <hi>John, John</hi> gives it out to the Church, and when Chriſt comes he will confirm the word, and make it all good, and ſo both Chriſt ſhall bee honoured, the Spirit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and the Inſtruments that gave out the word, be honoured.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Spirit deſires the coming of Chriſt, that ſo it ſelf may be no more grieved, no more quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. So 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Quench not the Spirit;</hi> in Eph. 4.30. <hi>Grieve not the Spirit, whereby yee are ſealed unto the day of redemption.</hi> The Spirit hath ſealed up men unto the day, that is, this day of Chriſts coming unto the day of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now ſaith the Spirit come, come that I may be no more grieved, I am grieved in the hearts of Saints daily, I am troubled by them, they do
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108127:40"/>many things that are contrary to my Nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my Holineſs; the Spirit is a tender thing, and ſoon grieved, now ſaith the Spirit, <hi>Come, come;</hi> then when Chriſt comes, the Spirit ſhall no more be grieved, there ſhall be a courſe taken with enemies.</p>
            <p>Here then we may ſee that this is a matter of weight, and worthy of conſideration, the coming of Chriſt, for the very Spirit of Chriſt deſires it. But ſo much for that.</p>
            <p>The whole Church alſo deſires it, even the Church Triumphant deſires it; I might inſiſt upon that firſt.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9, 10.
<note place="margin">The Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant deſires Chriſts coming.</note> 
               <hi>And when he had opened the fifth Seal, I ſaw under the Altar the ſouls of them that were ſlain for the Word of God, and for the teſtimony which they held; And they cryed with a loud voyce, ſaying, how long, how long O Lord, holy and true, doeſt thou not judge and avenge our bloud on them that dwell on the earth?</hi> Here is part of the Church Triumphant, crying, How long O Lord afore thou comeſt?</p>
            <p>Souls have no Tongues, you muſt know, but here by crying is meant the deſires of the Soul, they deſire Chriſts day might come, and ſo their enemies might be judged, and they might have their bodies united unto their ſouls, and be made compleat.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But it may be ſaid, Do the Souls in Heaven, and the Church in Heaven deſire Chriſt may go out of Heaven, and come down to earth? that ſhould ſeem ſtrange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Yes, The very Church in Heaven deſires the day of Chriſts coming, and what
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108127:41"/>if Chriſt do leave Heaven, and come down to earth, what hurt in that, for they being in Heaven do ſee the face of the Father, and beholding the face of the Father they have happineſs enough there, as the Angels always behold the face of my Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But ſecondly, when Chriſt comes they ſhall come with him, as you may ſee in <hi>Jude</hi> 14. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints.</hi> Here is a limited number put for an illimited, ten thouſand, that is, with all his Saints, ſo you have it in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.5. <hi>And the Lord my God ſhall come with all the Saints with him;</hi> Chriſt ſhall come, and all the Saints ſhall come with him when he comes; ſo in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. <hi>For if we beleeve that Jeſus dyed and roſe again, even ſo them alſo that ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him;</hi> they ſhall come with Chriſt when he comes, ſo that the very Church Triumphant are deſirous of the coming of Chriſt.

            <p>Q. <hi>Why doth the Church deſire the coming of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Why the Church deſires Chriſts coming.</note> 1. The Church deſires the coming of Chriſt, that ſo the Lord Chriſt himſelf may bee perfected, and compleated; Chriſt accounts himſelf imperfect in Heaven, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. ul. <hi>The Church is ſaid to be the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> and till Chriſt hath all with him that the Father hath given him, he is not compleat — The Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires Chriſt may have his fulneſs; Come Lord, and take all thine own; Come Lord, and gather in all thy Saints; Come Lord, and injoy all the Father hath given thee; it is, that Chriſt may have his fulneſs, be perfected, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Church deſires Chriſts coming, that ſo all the enemies of Chriſt may be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, eſpecially that thoſe Grand enemies of Chriſt may be brought down, as Antichriſt, and Sathan, thoſe are the Grand enemies of Chriſt, 2 Theſ. 2.8. And <hi>then ſhall that wicked be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſs of his coming.</hi> This is ſpoken of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, that wicked one, when Chriſt comes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108127:43"/>there ſhall be a total deſtruction of Antichriſt, and all that adhere to Antichriſt; then ſhall the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and the Beaſt be taken, as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. <hi>I ſaw the Beaſt, and the Kings of the earth, and their Armies gathered together, to make war with him that ſate on the Horſe, and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the Beaſt was taken, and with him the falſe Prophet that wrought Miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the Beaſt, and them that worſhipped his Image, &amp;c.</hi> When Chriſt comes the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet will be taken, theſe are Antichriſt, they ſhall bee taken and judged, and that enemy Sathan alſo, as in chap. 20. <hi>I ſaw an Angel come down from Heaven, having the Key of the bottomleſs Pit, and a great chain in his hand, and he laid hold on the Dragon that old Serpent, which is the Devil and Sathan, and bound him a thouſand years, and caſt him into the bottomleſs pit, and ſhut him up, and ſet a ſeal upon him that he ſhould not deceive the Nations any more, till the thouſand years ſhould be fulfilled;</hi> then ſhall the enemies of Chriſt bee brought under; the Church ſaith, Come, upon that account.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Church ſaith, Come, and deſires his coming, that ſo it ſelf might bee freed from all enemies within, and without, when Chriſt comes, this will bee made good. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. There was new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> came down from Heaven; What then? ſaith hee, <hi>Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and hee will dwell with them, and they ſhall bee his people, and God himſelf ſhall bee with them, and bee their God, and God ſhall wipe away all tears
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108127:44"/>from their eyes, and there ſhall bee no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain.</hi> When Chriſt comes, all enemies ſhall bee taken away, all Perſecutions, all Afflictions, all Temptations, yea all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions within, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Who ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me from this body of death? I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> when Chriſt comes I ſhall be delivered from this body of death, ſo that Chriſts coming is deſired of the Church, that ſhe may be freed from all enemies without, and that there might be no ſinning, nor grieving of the Spirit, that there might be no tears, no ſorrow, no crying, no pain, but freedom from all, inwardly, and outwardly.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And laſtly, The Church deſires the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, that ſhe may injoy all the good things that are to be had by his coming — That ſhe may have the choyce refreſhing that is ſpoken of in <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent yee therefore, and bee converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> Chriſt ſhall come, and there will be times of refreſhing, times of choyce refreſhing, ſuch refreſhings ſhall Souls have as they never had — That they may have the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. <hi>Becauſe the Creature it ſelf alſo ſhall bee delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the children of God;</hi> then ſhall the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God have liberty, and glorious liberty, never had they ſuch liberty as then they ſhall have — Then they ſhall likewiſe be partakers of great honour, that Chriſt will beſtow upon them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. <hi>He that overcometh,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:108127:44"/>will give to eat of the hidden Manna, and I will give him a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new name written;</hi> He ſhall have a title of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour — And a new <hi>Seat</hi> ſhall he have, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne.</hi> Chriſt will honour the Church then, and ſet her upon a Throne, exalt every member thereof, give them a new name, a new ſeat; great honour ſhall they have, inſomuch that it is ſaid in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. <hi>Thou ſhalt be as a crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal Diadem in the hand of thy God.</hi> They ſhall be honoured as Kings and Queens; <hi>He hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God,</hi> and we ſhall be honoured as Kings and Prieſts when Chriſt comes — Then ſhall they have nearer conjunction with Chriſt, and more communion with him then ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Let us bee glad, and rejoyce, and give honour to him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come.</hi> The marriage of the Lamb is come; <hi>Then</hi> ſhall bee the marriage, now it is a <hi>Bride,</hi> but then ſhall be the <hi>Marriage,</hi> then ſhall we rejoyce, for <hi>the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her ſelf ready.</hi> There will bee more intimate and ſweet communion; then will Chriſt let out his loves to the Soul indeed — Then will he lead his Spouſe, his Bride, his Wife into the Marriage Chamber, into the Wine-ſeller; then ſhall there be Apples of comfort, and Flaggons of Wine, then the ſpiced wine will be brought forth, there will bee more near conjunction, and ſweet communion with Chriſt then ever.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, then ſhall the Church bee made
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108127:45"/>like to Chriſt indeed, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>When he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him;</hi> we ſhall then bee transformed into the image of Chriſt fully, ſo that the Bride, the Church, deſires the coming of Chriſt upon theſe grounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> To make ſome uſe of this point.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Doth the Church deſire the coming of Chriſt? then this is a reproof to thoſe Chriſtians that do not minde Chriſt, nor deſire Chriſt, nor look after Chriſt at all; many Chriſtians they never deſire the coming of Chriſt, but they deſire other things, people have their deſires carried otherwiſe; The Mariner, he deſires a fit Wind to carry him to his Port; the Husband-man, hee deſires the Harveſt, that that would come; and ſo the Lawyer deſires the Term, that that would come; and the Woman deſires her Husband would return, that is abroad; and the Begger deſires a good Almes; but where is a ſoul deſires the coming of Chriſt? who ſaith, Come Lord, come quickly, come away? it is an argument that you have little or no grace in you, it is an Argument you are no friends to Chriſt, but rather enemies to Chriſt, when you do not minde Chriſt, and his coming, and deſire his coming; look into <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.48. to the end, <hi>And if that evil ſervant ſhall ſay in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming, and ſhall begin to ſmite his fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and to eat and drink with the drunken, the Lord of that ſervant ſhall come in a day that he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not ware of, and ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Doth the Church deſire the coming of Chriſt? then this informs us that Chriſt is deſirable, yea very deſirable, I ſay, very deſirable — Chriſt is deſired by the Spirit to come — Chriſt is deſired by the Church Triumphant to come — Chriſt is deſired by the Church Militant here in this world to come: Chriſt is very deſirable; what is there more deſirable than Chriſt? <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.7. he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there, <hi>The deſire of Nations;</hi> where there is but one Saint in a Nation, Chriſt is deſired there, whereſoever there be any godly ones, any that are indued with the Spirit of God, they deſire Chriſt, he is the deſire of Nations, all the Nations in the World, if they have any godly in them, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He is ſaid to bee white and ruddy, the chiefeſt of ten thouſand, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together lovely;</hi> who ſhould bee more deſired than Chriſt?

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108127:46"/>wiſdom and knowledge,</hi> Col. 2.3. and is not he deſirable? <hi>Chriſt is the Bridegroom,</hi> and is not he deſirable? ſuch a Bridegroom as never was in the world before, nor will be afterwards; no marvell then the Church ſaith, <hi>Come, come, come;</hi> he is deſirable.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If the Church do deſire Chriſt, then here is matter of comfort for the Church, matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for every beleeving ſoul that doth deſire Chriſt, comfort upon ſundry conſiderations —</p>
            <p n="1">1 The ſoul that doth ſo deſire Chriſt as you have heard, that deſires Chriſt Spiritually, that deſires Chriſt earneſtly — that hath a waking de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after Chriſt, a laſting deſire, a deſire that ſprings from promiſes, this is an Argument now unto thee of the truth of grace; ſuch deſires come from the Spirit of God, they are not from Nature, from the fleſh and bloud; fleſh and bloud doth not deſire the coming of Chriſt, but it is from a principle of Grace, from a Fountain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, from ſomething conformable to Chriſt, and this is an argument of comfort; many are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, they know not whether they have Grace or no; but doſt thou ſo deſire the coming of Chriſt? it is an argument of the truth of grace in thy heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is an Argument of a bleſſed condition, Matth. 5.10. <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs;</hi> bleſſed are they, in the Judgement of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf thou art a bleſſed Creature; Doſt thou hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs? To hunger and thirſt, is to have earneſt ſtrong deſires after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and if ſo, thou art bleſſed; Now, is not Chriſt righteouſneſs? Look into <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5, 6.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108127:46"/>ſaith the Lord, <hi>Behold, the days come, that I will raiſe unto</hi> David <hi>a righteous branch, and a King ſhall reign and proſper, and ſhall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Judgement and Juſtice in the earth; in his days</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be ſaved, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall dwell ſafely, and this is the name whereby hee ſhall be called, the Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi> Well, doſt thou hunger and thirſt now after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, after Chriſt and his righteouſneſs? Doeſt thou ſee thine own righteouſneſs, as ſpotted, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, loathſome, and throw it away, and hunger and thirſt after the righteouſneſs of Chriſt? what he hath purchaſed and procured by his Death, Sufferings, and Merits for poor ſinners, thou art a bleſſed Creature that doſt deſire Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thou ſhalt be ſatisfied, for ere long Chriſt will come, <hi>Yet a little while,</hi> Heb. 10. <hi>and hee that ſhall come will come, and will not tarry.

               </gap>cted, Wee have deſired, and we have waited long; why it is not long, Chriſt is a coming, the things that now we ſee do prognoſticate as much unto us — <hi>When
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108127:47"/>the Son of Man cometh, ſhall he finde faith on the earth?</hi> Where is any faithfulneſs in men? no faith to be found in men — And doth not the Devil rage now, and throw out puddle waters, Blaſphemies, Errours, and Hereſies? — And are not all Nations perplexed at this time, and know not what to do, and which way to turn them? — And is there not a ſpirit of Prayer abroad for the coming of Jeſus Chriſt, more than hath been in former days? And if it bee ſo, theſe are Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that Chriſts coming is nearer at hand then you are aware of, therefore here is comfort to the Saints and ſervants of Chriſt; Chriſt will come, and then they ſhall be ſatisfied that have deſired, and waited for his coming.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If it bee ſo, that the Church deſires the coming of Chriſt, then let me intreat you all to examine your ſelves, whether you do ſo deſire the coming of Chriſt, yea or no? and if you would know it, I ſhall commend two or three things to you, beyond what I have laid down —</p>
            <p n="1">1 That Soul that deſires the coming of Chriſt as the Bride here doth, lives not in any known ſin, that Soul that lives in any known ſin, that Soul cannot, that Soul doth not, that Soul dares not deſire the coming of Chriſt; I will give you one place of Scripture for it, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8 <hi>When the Lord Jeſus ſhall bee revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If a man be ignorant, and knows not God, and his duty, and if a man do know God, and his duty, and diſobey the Goſpel, dares that man now deſire the coming of Chriſt, that ſhall
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108127:47"/>come in flames of fire to render vengeance? Doth the Murderer deſire the coming of the Judge? Doth any guilty man deſire the coming of him that will bring him forth, and puniſh him for his guilt? therefore the Soul that deſires the coming of Chriſt, is a Soul that lives in no known Sin, he is neither ignorant of God. Goſpel, nor duty, nor diſobedent to God, Chriſt, or Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If you do deſire the coming of Chriſt in truth, and according to thoſe deſires before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, you will make ſome preparation for the coming of Chriſt; as you ſee the Bride, that ſaith Come; ſhe prepares for his coming, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.7. <hi>And his Wife hath made her ſelf ready;</hi> ſhe prepared for his coming. And ſo in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.40. <hi>Be yee therefore ready alſo, for the Son of Man cometh at an hour when yee think not.</hi> And the wiſe Virgins they made ready, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. ſaith he there, <hi>And while the fooliſh Virgins went to buy oyl, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom came, and they that were ready went in with him to the Marriage, and the door was ſhut.</hi> Now, what do you do towards Chriſts coming? do you purge out your Corruptions? Do you mortifie your Luſts? Do you renounce the World, and the vanities thereof? Do you trim and deck your ſelves with all Graces? if you do, it is an argument you deſire Chriſt, and your deſires are right.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Laſtly, Thoſe that deſire the coming of Chriſt in truth and ſincerity, they are glad when there are any appearances of the coming of Chriſt: any ſignes, any tokens of the coming of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.25. <hi>And there ſhall be ſigns in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108127:48"/>the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars, and upon the earth diſtreſs of Nations, with perplexity, the Sea and the waves roaring, mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things which are coming on the earth; and then ſhall they ſee the Son of Man coming in a Cloud, with power and great glory, and when theſe things begin to come to paſs, then look up, and lift up your heads, for your redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on draweth nigh.</hi> When there is any appearance of Chriſts coming, the Saints are glad, and thoſe are gracious, are glad. Is Chriſt a coming? now they lift up their heads, we ſhall bee freed from all our enemies without, and within; Chriſt ſhall be compleat; now all the wicked, Sathan, and Antichriſt ſhall bee judged, now wee ſhall have that refreſhing that never was before, now wee ſhall enjoy the glorious liberty that we have wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for, and lookt for, now wee ſhall bee freed from ſin, now we ſhall have have more intimate communion with him, now we ſhall be made like unto him; this is that that makes the heart rejoyce at the apprehenſion of his coming, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine your ſelves whether you have ſuch deſires of his coming, as here the Bride had.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The laſt uſe of the point is this; An exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to us to deſire the coming of Chriſt, and to ſay with the Bride here, <hi>Come Lord, come;</hi> the Spirit ſaith, come, the Bride ſaith, come, either we are not indued with the Spirit of God, or we are not the Bride of Chriſt, if we will not ſay, <hi>Come.</hi> Beſides theſe, conſider</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is an argument of love to Chriſt to deſire his coming, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>To all them that love his appearing.</hi> If we do not deſire his coming, it
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108127:48"/>argues little love to Chriſt; A woman that doth not deſire the coming of her Husband, hath little love to her Husband.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It will be a Marriage day to the Soul, the day of his coming, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.7, 9. and Chriſt will rejoyce over his then as a man doth over his Bride, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.5. therefore ſeeing the Spirit of God deſires it, and the Bride deſires it, let us alſo deſire Chriſts coming, manifeſt our love to Chriſt, and long for the marriage day.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But may ſome ſay, What ſhall we do to have ſuch deſires begotten in us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

<note place="margin">What we ſhould do to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after Chriſts coming begotten in us.</note> are we not all Sinners, full of ſin and corruption? <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. when he conſidered the Sin that was in him, how carnal he was, how he was carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Captive, how the ſin in his members did warre againſt the Law of his minde, what a wretched creature he was, he longed for Chriſt; <hi>Who ſhall deliver me?

            <p n="2">2 Conſider the evils and confuſions that are in fellow ſervants, the Devil deceives the Nations, Antichriſt tyrannizeth, great ones oppreſs one another, much of <hi>Babylon</hi> is yet in <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3 Conſider the great good you ſhall have by Chriſts coming; it will be a time of refreſhing, it will be a time of liberty, a time of glory, a time of making you like unto Jeſus Chriſt; it will be a

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though a wicked man can never cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially deſire the coming of Chriſt, yet it is the duty of every wicked man, of all men in the world, and upon this account,</p>
            <p n="1">1 As they are the Creatures of God; all men are Gods Creatures, and being Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is their duty to deſire Gods Will, being revealed, for to be fulfilled, therefore all wicked men taking notice that this is Gods Will revealed, that Chriſt muſt come, it is their duty to deſire the fulfilling of Gods Will, and not their own will.

            <p n="2">2 As they are the Servants of God, and have talents committed unto them; every one that is the ſervant of another, and hath ſomething com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his truſt, it is his duty to deſire the coming of his Lord and Maſter, the coming of him to whom he muſt give his account; there is not a man in this World but hath ſome talent or other given unto him; ſome interpret that place in <hi>John, He is the Light of every man that cometh into the world,</hi> to be meant of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and reaſon every man hath; every one therefore having his underſtanding and reaſon from Chriſt, ſhould deſire his coming.</p>

And what, will you not prepare for it? Chriſt will ſay, What, did you not know that I would come again? did not I tell you? Did not all my Servants tell you of it? Did not <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, Peter,</hi> Angels, did not they tell you of my coming? Why did you not prepare for it? You have gotten Lamps, but where is your Oyl? You make profeſſion, and you bear my name, why have you not prepared for my coming? Men will be inexcuſable, like the man that had not on the Wedding Garment, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in here?</hi> his mouth was ſtopt; ſo you will bee inexcuſable, and your mouthes will be ſtopt, that do not prepare for the coming of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Let us conſider it is our duty to prepare for the coming of Chriſt, it is made known in the Word, and it is made known to you this day; O prepare for the coming of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24 44. <hi>Be yee alſo ready, for in ſuch an hour as yee think not, the Son of Man cometh;</hi> bee ready —</p>
               <p>What is this preparation we ſhould make for Chriſts coming? — there are three or four things to be done.</p>
               <p n="1">1 See that you caſt off every thing that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108127:53"/>your going out to Chriſt, and meeting of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Wherefore, ſeeing we are compaſſed about with ſo great a cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, let us lay aſide every weight, and the ſin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and let us run with patience the race that is ſet before us, looking unto Jeſus the Author and finiſher of our faith.</hi> Well, lay aſide every weight, and every burden, every Sin that doth ſo beſet you, and bows you down, cloggs and hinders you from going out to meet Chriſt, from running the race that is ſet before you, caſt off all things which cumber and burden you, all your luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, all baſe thoughts and practiſes, all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ends and aymes that you have; lay aſide every burden.</p>
               <p n="2">2 See that you do adorn and beautifie your ſelves with all Graces, you know the Bride, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. did trim up her ſelf, and make her ſelf ready, put on her beſt apparrel, put on Chriſt, put on all Graces. When you expect ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Friend to come to your Houſes, you make preparation for him, you will not only have the houſe ſwept, but you will have the windows and tables rubbed, you will have your floores ſtrown, you will waſh and perfume your ſelves, and be in a decent, a comely poſture, and habit; the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will come, and he is a coming daily, you muſt therefore make ready for him, and prepare your hearts, your conſciences, your wil, your affections, and underſtandings, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, the body, all muſt bee fitted for Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 You ſhould put forth your deſires, as here the Bride doth, and the Spirit doth, O come
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108127:53"/>Lord, come Lord; the Soul that doth heartily deſire the coming of Chriſt, is well prepared for his coming.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Laſtly, you muſt wait daily for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt; <hi>Job</hi> waited all his appointed time for the coming of his Redeemer. And <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.35, 36. <hi>Let your loyns bee girded about, and your lights burning, and yee your ſelves like unto men that wait for their Lord when he will return.</hi> This is the preparation that you are to make, eſpecially ſee that you have faith in Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the <hi>Philippians, I labour to win Chriſt, and to be found in Chriſt, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mine own righteouſneſs;</hi> ſo you ſhould have faith in Chriſt, and ſay, In the Lord Chriſt have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength, I have none in my ſelf, but all is in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Second Obſervation is, That the coming of Chriſt is a thing to be hearkened unto, <hi>Let him that heareth, ſay come;</hi> Every man doth not hearken unto the coming of Chriſt, he hears of it, it may be, but he doth not hearken unto it; it is one thing to hear it, another thing to hearken unto it; <hi>Let him that heareth ſay, Come;</hi> To hear is ordinary, but to <hi>hearken</hi> is rare, and ſo to hearken as to ſay, <hi>come,</hi> is rare; few ſo hearken as to ſay, Come Lord, come Lord, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Let him that hath an ear hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches;</hi> Let every man that hath an ear hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches; ſo let every one that hath an ear hearken unto the coming of Chriſt, heed, attend it, obſerve, minde this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, for it is a thing of great concernment, and things of concernment you will hear and hearken
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108127:54"/>unto them, attend and obſerve — the coming of the Lord Chriſt is of very great concernment.</p>
               <p>What concernment you will ſay is it of? I ſhall ſhew it you in ſome particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It is of great concernment upon this account,
<note place="margin">Of what concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Chriſts coming is.</note> That there will bee then the greateſt diſcovery made of men and women that ever was in the World, then ſhall the Sheep be diſcovered from the Goats, then ſhall the Lambs bee diſcovered from the Wolves, then ſhall thoſe that fear God be diſcovered from thoſe that fear him not, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. <hi>Then ſhall yee return, and diſcern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not; Then,</hi> when Chriſt ſhall come will be the clear diſcerning, then will the difference be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſealed ones, and thoſe that are not ſealed, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. Thoſe that have overcome, and have white Garments, and Palms in their hands, and thoſe that have not overcome, and are in their wickedneſs; then will thoſe that are redeemed from the Earth ſtand with the Lamb upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> then will there be ſuch a diſcovery made of who are right, and who are wrong, as never was; Then ſhall Chriſt ſay, Who is on my ſide, who? Then ſhall all Chriſts friends run to him, then ſhall all his enemies hang down their heads.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is of great concernment, becauſe then when Chriſt comes will be the greateſt change and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that ever was here in the World; there was a great change when the Floud came in, in <hi>Noahs</hi> days, and drowned the World; there will be as great at Chriſts coming, yea a greater change and alteration than that, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Nevertheleſs we, according to his promiſe, look
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108127:54"/>for new Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs;</hi> Then ſhall there bee new Heavens, and a new Earth, the Heavens ſhall bee renewed, the Earth ſhall bee renewed. Then there will be, as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. <hi>I ſaw a new Heaven, and a new Earth, for the firſt Heaven, and the firſt Earth were paſſed away, and there was no more Sea, and I ſaw the holy City, new Jeruſalem, coming down from God;</hi> Then ſhall be the new Heavens and Earth, the new Jeruſalem, and there will be a great change and alteration then, the Heavens then ſhall have new qualities, and new diſpoſitions, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce new effects; the earth then ſhall be refined, and renewed, and put into its primitive eſtate, and be made fit to bee a foot-ſtool for Chriſt when hee ſits in his Throne to judge the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3 When Chriſt comes will bee the greateſt diſtreſs and trouble to the wicked that ever was, and the greateſt comfort and conſolation to the godly that ever was; there will bee the greateſt diſtreſs and trouble to wicked men that ever was, 2 Pet. 3.10. <hi>But the Day of the Lord will come as a Thief in the night, in the which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall paſs away with a great noyſe, and the Elements ſhall meli with fervent heat, the Earth alſo, and the works that are therein ſhall bee burnt up.</hi> What work will here be now when all ſhall bee on fire, and Chriſt ſhall come in flames of fire — What work will this make? — you ſhall ſee what work it will make with the wicked and ungodly, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>And the Heavens departed as a ſcrowl when it is roled together, and every mountain and Iſland
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108127:55"/>were moved out of their places, and the Kings of the earth, and great men, and the rich men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty men, and every bond-man, and every free-man kid themſelves in the Dens, and in the Rocks of the mountains, and ſaid to the mountains and rocks fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi> it will be a dreadful, a terrible day to all wicked ones; when Chriſt comes, who ſhall bee able to ſtand — but it will be as comfortable a day to the godly, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. New Jeruſalem came down from Heaven, <hi>Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God, and God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, neither ſhall there be any more pain, for the former things are paſſed away; and he that ſate upon the Throne ſaid, Behold, I make all things new; and he ſaid unto me, Write, for theſe words are true and faithful;</hi> it will be a day of great comfort to all Beleevers, to all Saints, to all that fear God: all tears ſhall bee wiped from their eyes, there ſhall be no more death, no more pain.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Again, It is of great concernment, in regard that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhal appear eminently in his greatneſs, and in his glory; Chriſt before appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red like a Servant, in a ſtate of Humiliation, but then when he comes he ſhall appear eminently, in greatneſs and glory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24 30. <hi>And then
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108127:55"/>ſhall appear the ſign of the Son of Man in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and then ſhall all the Tribes of the earth mourn, and they ſhall ſee the Son of Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Clouds of Heaven, with power and great glory.</hi> Chriſt ſhall come with power and great glory; It will be a day of glory indeed, for the World ſhall be filled with the glory of Chriſt, <hi>They ſhall ſee the ſign of the Son of Man in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> What is the ſign of the Son of Man? not the Croſs, as the Papiſts ſay, nor other fancies of men, but as you may gather out of the twenty ſeventh verſe, <hi>For as the Lightning cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth even unto the Weſt, ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of Man be;</hi> hee ſhall come with Lightning; the brightneſs of Chriſt ſhall fill the World with the glory of Chriſt; Chriſt is glorified, and Chriſts coming now ſhall be ſo ſhining, and ſo glorious, that there ſhall be an appearance of his coming from the luſter that ſhall be ſeen in the World; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in <hi>Acts</hi> 26.13. that <hi>he ſaw a light brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Sun at noon day;</hi> Chriſt being ſo glorious, he is ſo bright that when he comes hee will fill the world with glory; ſo that it will be an eminent day indeed; a day of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the coming of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. So then you ſee that this is a day, a time to be hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto; let him that heareth ſay, come.</p>
               <p>Now what is the uſe of this point?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. This ſerves for reproof, and reproof of thoſe that do not at all liſten after the coming of the Lord Chriſt; many they hearken after any thing but the coming of Chriſt, they hearken af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter news out of all quarters, they hearken after ſhips from all parts, and Ports in the World, they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108127:56"/>hearken after Husbands, Friends, and Relations, they hearken after good Bargains, good Matches, good Houſes good Land, good Air, good Apparrel; they hearken after new Faſhions, and the like, but who hearkens after the coming of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus? this is a fault too general, a common Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that we do not hearken after the coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This is matter of comfort unto thoſe that do hearken after Chriſt, and ſo hearken as to ſay, Come Lord, come Lord — It is matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto them, they are of the Brides minde, they are of the Spirits minde, they are of that ſide the Bride and the Spirit are, let him that hears ſay, come; if he do ſo <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>hearken</hi> as to ſay, <hi>come,</hi> I ſay, he is of the ſame ſide with the Bride and the Spirit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e is indeed the Bride, hee hath the Spirit that doth ſo. This is matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Chriſt will come, and will ſeparate thee ere long from all thine enemies, free thee from all evils; ere long he ſhall come, and all tears ſhall be wip'd from thine eyes, and there ſhall bee no more ſorrow, pain, or death; it is comfort to thoſe that do ſo. As God took care of the Mourners in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they were ſealed, ſo thoſe that deſire the coming of Chriſt, they ſhall be revealed, they are the Sealed ones, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones, and they ſhall ſtand with the Lamb, and be with the Lamb; they ſhall lift up their heads, and rejoyce in the coming of Chriſt, when others howl, and run to Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Let us all then ſo hearken to the coming of Chriſt as to deſire it ſincerely and heartily; you have heard of it, hearken after it, inquire whether
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108127:56"/>Chriſt bee not coming daily; conſult with the Word of God, ſee whether all things are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, or neere accompliſhed that be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>When you ſee the Figg-tree bud, then you ſay that Summer is at hand;</hi> — If an Ambaſſadour were to come into the Land from ſome Forreign State, how you would hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, whence comes the Ambaſſabour? what comes he about? What if <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſhould come from Heaven? What if <hi>David, Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Aaron?</hi> What if <hi>Eliah, Enoch,</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould come from Heaven? If God ſhould reveal by his Spirit unto you, that theſe men ſhould come from Heaven, would not you hearken after their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? God hath revealed it by his Spirit, that Chriſt ſhall come, and come with ten thouſands with him, he ſhall come with <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch,</hi> and <hi>Eliah,</hi> and the reſt of them, and will you not hearken after the coming of Chriſt? O hearken after his coming, and ſay, <hi>Come Lord, come quickly?</hi> You ſee of how great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is, it will bee a day of diſcovery, and it will be a day of diſtreſs, a day of change, a day of comfort, a day of glory to Chriſt; and it will be a day of ſeparation, wherein the wicked and godly ſhall be ſeparated one from another, you ſhall bee no more troubled with the wicked; mark, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15. <hi>For without are Doggs, and Sorcerers, and Whore-mongers, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and Idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a lye;</hi> they ſhall be ſhut out of the new Heaven, and the new Earth, and chap. 21. ult. <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108127:57"/>or maketh a lye, but they which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Lambs book of life.</hi> Then there ſhall be no more a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> a <hi>Jebuſite,</hi> a <hi>Hittite</hi> in the Land, none to trouble or moleſt, therefore J ſay, hearken unto the coming of Chriſt, then ſhall yee ſee the King in his glory, and in his beauty.</p>
               <p>But to winde up all, let me tell you, There is another coming of Chriſt which you ſhall do well to hearken unto, and to deſire; before this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal and glorious coming of Chriſt, I ſay, there is another coming of Chriſt which wee are to minde, and that is, Chriſts Spiritual coming, Chriſts coming in his Ordinances, for Chriſt comes in every Ordinance unto us, <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock;</hi> in every Ordinance Chriſt comes, and hee ſtands at the door and knocks, and he would have entrance, <hi>Hee that heareth you, heareth me;</hi> and in breaking of Bread; in that Ordinance there is the Lords Body to be diſcerned, there is communion with him in his Bloud in the Cup, and in his Fleſh in the Bread, Chriſt is Spiritually there — So in Prayer Chriſt is there, and in all his Ordinances, <hi>Now let him that heareth ſay, come;</hi> come Lord Jeſus, and fill up thine Ordinances with thine own preſence, otherwiſe Ordinances are empty things, they are Veſſels without Wine, they are Baggs without Silver or Gold, they are Canes without Sugar; If Chriſt do not fill up his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances they will be nothing unto you, therefore let him that heareth ſay, Come Lord, come Lord, afford thy preſence, fill up thine Ordinances; come Lord, and do thou bleſs thine Ordinances,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108127:57"/>and bleſs us in the uſe of thine Ordinances; for in <hi>Acts</hi> 3. he is ſent of the Father to bleſs; — ſo again, Come Lord, and do thou counſel; he is wonderful in counſelling, he counſels, teaches, and inſtructs in his Ordinances; — So come Lord, and ſtrengthen, for he doth ſtrengthen all his, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me; In the way of the Lord is ſtrength;</hi> in the Ordinances of the Lord is ſtrength, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Strengthened with all might by his Spirit in the inner man</hi> — Come Lord and comfort, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in his Ordinances, he comforts poor feeble Souls, doubting Souls, and ſtaggering Souls; hee comforts them with flaggons of Wine, and apples of comfort — I, let him that heareth ſay, Come Lord and heal; hee heals wounded Souls, hee heals wounded Conſciences in his Ordinances, Mal, 4. <hi>The Son of righteouſneſs ſhall ariſe with healing in his wings;</hi> he hath healing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in his Ordinances to heal your Souls, therefore let him that heareth ſay, Come; come Lord and fill up, come Lord and ſtrengthen, come Lord and counſel, come Lord and heal; and ſo you will finde the coming of Chriſt to be deſirable to you indeed.</p>

            </p>
            <p>There is a double thirſt, a Natural thirſt, and a Spiritual thirſt; — A Natural thirſt you are all acquainted with, you know what it is to bee
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108127:58"/>thirſty; it is the deſire of that which is cool and moyſt, but this is not the thing here meant, a Natural thirſt; there is a Spiritual thirſt, which in the general is, An efficacious deſire after Chriſt, and the good to be received by him.</p>
            <p>Now for the opening of this Thirſt, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is in Natural thirſt,</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is an abſence of moyſture, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My moyſture is dried up,</hi> my moyſture is gone.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a ſence of it, men and women are ſenſible that their moyſture is ſpent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is the knowledge of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſuitable to releeve them.</p>
            <p>And then Fourthly comes actual thirſt. Upon theſe Four ariſes thirſt.</p>
            <p>So in this Spiritual thirſt, There is an abſence of moyſture, there is a want of Grace, a want of that is Spiritual, a want of Chriſt —</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Soul is ſenſible of it, as <hi>Siſera</hi> ſaid, <hi>Give me a little water to drink for I am thirſty;</hi> there was moyſture gone, and ſence of it, and water to be had, and actual deſire; ſo here in this Spiritual thirſt, there is a want of Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, we had his Image but that is gone, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>In our fleſh dwels no good;</hi> there is no Spiritual good dwels in a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man — And then we muſt be ſenſible of this, and ſo know there is ſome relief to be had, and that is, Chriſt proclaims in the Goſpel, holds out in the Word the water of Life; — And then the Soul comes actually to deſire Chriſt, when Chriſt told the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> of Water of Life,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:108127:59"/>Water that ſhe ſhould drink of and thirſt no more, then ſhe came to deſire; ſo a Soul that knows Chriſt to be the Water of Life, and findes and feels an abſence of moyſture, comes actually to deſire this Water of Life, therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Let him that is athirſt come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For our further proceeding in this, I ſhall ſhew you why this thirſting is required.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The nature and properties of it, and then make uſe,
<note place="margin">Why this thirſting is required.</note> where we ſhall ſhew ſome differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the thirſting of men.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That this thirſting is required in men to fit them for Chriſt, for till wee come to thirſt wee have a fulneſs of our own, but when men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are once thirſty, have a Spiritual thirſt, then they are empty of what is their own; they have puddle waters of their own to drink, Ciſterns of their own, and ſomething of their own that they do refreſh themſelves withall, their own good natures, their own parts, their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and performances, they are full of theſe; but now when they come to this Spiritual thirſt they are emptied of all theſe, there is a breach made between Sin and their Souls, and ſo all is let out of this nature. This new Wine muſt not be put in full Bottles, the Bottles muſt be empty. When a man therefore thirſts after Chriſt, this man now ſees that hee hath nothing to releeve him but Chriſt, and this man is fit for Chriſt, he is empty; A Veſſel that hath a fulneſs before cannot receive Wine, or Milk, or Water, or any Liquor what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; but when a Veſſel is emptied of all was in it, then it is capable of ſomething elſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This thirſting is required, becauſe men wil not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108127:59"/>come to Chriſt elſe, if men be not thirſty they wil not come to Chriſt; <hi>If any man thirſts let him come; The full ſtomack loathes the Honey-combe;</hi> If the ſweeteſt Honey-comb be preſented to a full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tomack it loathes it. In <hi>Luke</hi> 14. there are many invited to come to the great Supper, the Supper that Chriſt had made, the Dainties of the Goſpel, but becauſe they were not thirſty, not one of them would come; ſaith one, <hi>I have a yoke of Oxen, to go and try;</hi> Another, <hi>I have a Farm to go and ſee;</hi> ſaith a third, <hi>I have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Wife, and I cannot come:</hi> But had they been athirſt they would have come to Chriſt, the Water of Life; but where there is no thriſt there will be no coming. Tell a Drunkard that is full of Beer, Wine, or Hot Waters, tell him of the beſt Wine, of the moſt excellent Drink that is, he hath no minde to it, he is full, and will not come to it; and therefore without thirſting, men will not come to Chriſt. A man that is not ſick, hee will not come to the Phyſician, but a man that is ſick, and full of pain, that man will come to the Phyſician.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is required, becauſe if men do come to Chriſt, yet they will not drink when they come unleſs they bee thirſty; you may bring a Beaſt unto the Water, but unleſs he be athirſt he will not drink; ſo many men may be preſt by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to come to Chriſt, to come to the Goſpel and the means of Grace, but unleſs they be thirſty they will not drink; VVhen men come to a Feaſt, and there are variety of VVines and Drinks there, if not thirſty, they will fault the drink though VVine, and ſpeak evil of it, and ſay, It is too new, too tart, too flat, ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108127:60"/>or other they will have againſt it; why, they are not thirſty, whereas if they were thirſty they would drink; ſo is it with men and women that come to Chriſt, not being thirſty, they fault the Doctrin of Chriſt, which is the Drink hee gives them, why you muſt deny your ſelves, you muſt part with things that are deareſt to you; you muſt take up a Croſs, and follow Chriſt; O this is drink that is full of Lees, this is drink that hath no ſavour in it, and will not down with men and women, therefore unleſs men be thirſty they will not drink the drink that Chriſt hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them; this Water of Life, they will not ſee any life in it, but they will reject it, and lay it aſide, this Doctrin will not down with them; therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Let him that is athirſt come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Chriſt ſhall tell you of Reproaches, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, Temptations, loſs of Liberty, and loſs of Lives for his ſake, and the Goſpels, this will not down with men and women — As Chriſt is refreſhing drink, ſo Chriſt is purging drink, and the ingredients in the one, are pleaſing things; the Promiſes, and the Loves of God, and Chriſt; but in the other, are very ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſh things, Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Sword, Death, Fire, and things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, theſe are in the purging drink.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Let him that is at hirſt come,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; becauſe though men do come, and do drink, yet unleſs they be athirſt, they will not ſtay with Chriſt, ſtay at this Fountain, and be content with this drink long, but they will give it over; As many have come, and entred upon the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel, and have taken upon them the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108127:60"/>Livery of Chriſt, but they have not long ſtayed in Chriſts Family, they have not liked his Diet, his Drink, they have gone away again. Men think it a hard thing to be tied to drink one kinde of drink always, yet thoſe that have the Gravel, the Stone, they will bee content to drink ſuch drink as will advantage them; ſo thoſe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are truly thirſty after Chriſt, they will be content to drink ſuch drink as Chriſt will give them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſs men be thirſty they will not ſtay with Chriſt, not abide in his Family.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Laſtly, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Let him that is athirſt come;</hi> becauſe ſuch have a ſuitableneſs in them to what Chriſt hath for them. Chriſt in the Scripture is ſet out to bee a Phiſitian, to bee a Saviour, to be a Fountain of Living Water, and to be at a Throne of Grace; now thoſe that are athirſt have ſomething ſuitable to this; A thirſty man, he would fain have his Wounds healed; he that hath this Spiritual thirſt hath Wounds, and I ſay he would fain have them healed, and ſo he will come to Chriſt, and Chriſt is a Phiſitian, and he will heal his VVounds; A thirſty man is a loſt man, and he would fain be ſaved; Chriſt is a Saviour, and he will come to him for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; A thirſty man is dry, Chriſt is a Fountain, and he will come to Chriſt for the VVater of Life, to have the heat of ſin quenched, and to have the VVrath of God which is apprehended pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and ſo this man he would have the guilt taken out of his Conſcience, he would have his ſins pardoned; Chriſt is at a Throne of Grace, and holds out a golden Scepter; this man will come to Chriſt to have his ſins pardoned, therefore
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108127:61"/>Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Let him that is athirſt come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, For the nature and property of this Spiritual thirſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1 This thirſt,
<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Spiritual thirſt.</note> it is an afflictive thirſt, a thirſt that doth afflict and trouble the Soul where it is; when men are athirſt indeed, O how doth that thirſt afflict, men are more afflicted with thirſt than with hunger, becauſe there is a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of <hi>humidum</hi> then <hi>ſiccum,</hi> as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers do obſerve; men are more deſirous of moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture than of that which is dry, and therefore where there is a true thirſt there is affliction of ſpirit. It is ſaid of <hi>Sampſon</hi> in the fifteenth of <hi>Judges,</hi> that he was ſore a thirſt, he did greatly, ſorely thirſt, his thirſt was a pain unto him, a trouble unto him, a perplexity unto him; ſo where there is this Spiritual thirſt, it is very troubleſome and afflictive unto the Soul, when once the guilt of ſin ſtirs, the Fire of Hell is kindled in the Soul, the VVrath of God is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, a man ſees himſelf loſt and undone, this man is athirſt now, and this thirſt is very troubleſom unto him; this is the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of this Spiritual thirſt, it doth afflict and trouble the Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The nature of this thirſt is: that it is vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it carries the Soul with a kind of vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy after the thing thirſted for, <hi>Give me children or elſe I dye;</hi> there is a vehemency in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, it makes the deſire very violent, earneſt, it is not a laſie ſluggiſh deſire, as is in many, <hi>Balaam</hi> deſires to dye the death of the righteous, the Sluggard luſteth and hath not; that is a <hi>Voleitie,</hi> as the School-men diſtinguiſh it from <hi>Voluntas;</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:108127:61"/>but this is a vehement earneſt deſire, ſaith <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timeus</hi> in <hi>Mark</hi> 10. <hi>Jeſus thou Son of</hi> David <hi>have mercy upon me;</hi> he was carried out with a vehemency of ſpirit; and when the Apoſtles and others charged him to hold his peace, hee was more vehement, <hi>Jeſus thou Son of</hi> David <hi>have mercy on me;</hi> he cries lowder, ſo that this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual thirſt in the Soul is vehement, and carries out the Soul with earneſtneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This Spiritual thirſt is Complanitive, full of Complaints, it cannot be ſilent, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.10. ſaith <hi>Jehoram</hi> there, <hi>There was no water for the Hoſt, and for the Cattel that followed them, And the King of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid, Alas, that the Lord hath called theſe three Kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab;</hi> And ſo in <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.5. <hi>Wherefore have yee made us to come up out of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>to bring us into this evil place? it is no place of Seed, or of Figgs, or Vines, or of Pomgranets, neither is there any water to drink.</hi> O wee are come into a place where there is no water; ſo a Soul that hath this Spiritual thirſt, it complains, and doth expreſs it ſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>Paul</hi> there found ſin in him, that he was carnal ſold under ſin, led Captive, a Law in his Members warring againſt the Law of his minde, and what ſaith he, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me?</hi> he was thirſty now after deliverance, and hee complains of his Corruption, and inquires after deliverance; ſo that a gracious Soul in this caſe it is complaining, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.4. There <hi>David</hi> complains, that <hi>his moyſture was turned into the drought of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> O when ſaith the Soul will this drought be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108127:62"/>taken a way, and where, where is there water to be had, and where is there remedy? the Soul is full of complaints.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And laſtly, the nature of this thirſt is ſuch, as that it is never ſatisfied without the Lord Chriſt. A true Spiritual thirſt is inſatiable till it hath Chriſt himſelf; ſaith Chriſt to the woman of <hi>Samaria, I have water to give thee, that thou having once drank ſhalt never thirſt any more, but it ſhall ſpring up as a fountain of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving water in thee; Lord, evermore ſaith ſhee give me of that water</hi> —A nd ſo <hi>Peter,</hi> in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. <hi>Thou haſt the words of eternal life:</hi> and to whom ſhould we go? O thou art a Fountain, and thou art a Fountain of living waters, <hi>Words of eternal life,</hi> and to whom ſhould we go? wee will go to no other, we are ſatisfied with thee. Men that have Spiritual thirſt, will not be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with honours, with pleaſures, with gifts, they will not be ſatisfied with any thing but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; ſo then you ſee what this thirſt is, why it is required, and the properties of it.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>Application.</head>
               <p>Firſt of all, is this thirſt of this nature you have heard? then here we may be informed there are few Spiritual thirſters; it was in my thoughts to have made this an Obſervation, and have proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted it, but I rather referred it to the Uſe; and here I ſay wee may ſee there are few Spiritual thirſters, which I ſhall a little inſiſt upon, ſaith Chriſt here, <hi>Let him that thirſteth, &amp;c.</hi> If there be a man that thirſteth let him come. So in Joh. 7.37. <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108127:62"/>me and drink.</hi> And in the Philippians, <hi>All men ſeek their own, and no man the things of Chriſt;</hi> there is no thirſting after Chriſt. Now a little to inſiſt upon this.</p>
               <p>Few Spiritual Thirſters there are; for few are afflicted in ſpirit; few are ſenſible of the burden of ſin, ſo as to be afflicted in ſpirit. Few have any vehement deſires after Spiritual things? few do complain of the corruption of their Nature, few are reſtleſs till they have gotten Chriſt, and are ſatisfied with him — And to make it evident that they are few; Conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, that a great number of men in the world are worldly and earthly minded, theſe do not thirſt after Chriſt; no worldly, no earthly-minded man is a Spiritual thirſter after Chriſt, the text is clear for it, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their belly, and whoſe glory is in their ſhame, who minde earthly things.</hi> Mark, thoſe who minde earthly things are enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, and do not Spiritually thirſt after Chriſt, no, they are enemies to Chriſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. <hi>Yee Adulterers, and Adultereſſes, know yee not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the love of the World is enmity with God? whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is an enemy to God.</hi> If mens love be worldly, and they earthly minded, they do not thirſt after Chriſt, no, they are enemies to God and Chriſt. <hi>John</hi> tells you in his firſt Epiſtle, ch. 2.15. <hi>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world, if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him:</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:108127:63"/>The love of the Father is not in him, the love of Chriſt is not in him, he hath no thirſting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after God and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Rich men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Thoſe that will bee rich pierce themſelves through with many cares and ſorrows, and drown their ſouls in perdition.</hi> Do theſe thirſt after Chriſt? no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded man or woman hath any Spiritual thirſt after Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 None that do neglect the means of Grace do thirſt after Chriſt, and yet do not a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude neglect the means, they never read the Scriptures, they never hear a Sermon (or very ſeldom) they never pray, and do theſe thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt? If they thirſted Spiritually after Chriſt, they would uſe the means to come to Chriſt; If a man were athirſt, he would uſe the means to get ſomething to quench his thirſt; ſo if men do thirſt after Chriſt, they would read the Goſpel, ſtudy the Goſpel, call upon the name of God, and Chriſt. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>Power out thy Wrath upon the men that call not upon thy name.</hi> Now when men call not upon the name of God, and Chriſt, uſe not the means, they are the enemies of God, and Chriſt, and wrath is their portion; therefore you ſee whole Nations never looks after Chriſt, multitudes in this place never look after Chriſt, nor uſe the means, theſe do not thirſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Again, no unregenerate man doth Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thirſt after Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The Natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them; becauſe they are Spiritually
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108127:63"/>diſcerned.</hi> And if he do not know them, it is the old rule, There is no deſire of that. Now men that have not the Spirit, as appears <hi>ver.</hi> 12. they cannot thirſt. So in <hi>Jude,</hi> it is there, <hi>They are ſenſual, not having the Spirit;</hi> Now what a multitude of men and women are there in the world that have not the Spirit, they jear at the Spirit, and others know not whether there bee a Spirit of God or no; Oh! multitudes, the greateſt part are in the broad way! Theſe now do not Spiritually thirſt after Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Again, thoſe that do live and go on in any known way of wickedneſs, they <hi>do not</hi> deſire Chriſt, nor <hi>cannot</hi> deſire the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; And do not moſt men and women go on in ſome way of wickedneſs or other, and they make their Luſts their god, and they would not have that god deſtroyed; they ſay to Chriſt as the Devils did, <hi>Why doſt thou come to torment us before the time.</hi> When men and women walk in any way of wickedneſs, and it is their ordinary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, they do not deſire the coming of Chriſt, neither can they; Many things I might inſtance in this way, but it is too evident there are few that do Spiritually thirſt after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>But whence is it that ſo few do ſo Spiritually thirſt after Chriſt?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Whence is it that ſo few do thirſt after Chriſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, It is from the ignorance of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Law of God hath never entered into their Souls, for had the Law of God entred to convince them of ſin, for by the Law comes the knowledge of ſin, had the Law ever entred to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the ſinfulneſs of ſin that is in them, of the pollution of ſin, how it defiles them; of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108127:64"/>diſtance ſin hath ſet them at from God, of the Curſe hangs over their heads by reaſon of their ſin, they would then begin to inquire, and to thirſt after Chriſt, but the Law hath never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into them, they are ignorant of the Law of God, ignorant of the truths of God, and where there is blindneſs, and ignorance, there can be no true thirſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is from the conceitedneſs of men and women, moſt men and women are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of their own goodneſs, they have good hearts, good natures, lead honeſt lives, they are civil, and juſt, they walk unblameably, and theſe things they reſt upon, and ſo they feed upon theſe husks; <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every man is firſt in his own cauſe;</hi> A man is righteous in his own eyes, and a man will judge himſelf, and juſtifie himſelf, and think himſelf better than another; and we are naturally prone to Hypocriſie, to ſee a mote in anothers eye, and not a beam in our own. The Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> conceited her ſelf to be rich, and to be full, &amp;c. and to want nothing, when as ſhe was poor, and miſerable, and blinde and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and wanted all things. This is natural, for men and women to conceit well of themſelves; The Phariſee faſts twice in the week, &amp;c. And not like this Publican; this is incident to us all to think too well of our ſelves, and hence it is that men and women do not thirſt after Chriſt, but will be their own Saviours, and ſo undoe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This is from men and womens miſtakes:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Of God. 2 Of the Creature.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:108127:64"/> 1 Of God, They think God is like unto themſelves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>Thou thoughteſt that I was ſuch a one as thy ſelf, but I will reprove thee, and ſet thy ſins in order before thee, and I will tear thee in peeces, and none ſhall deliver thee unleſs thou do otherwiſe then ſo.</hi> Wee think God is all Mercy, and that he is not ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo juſt, ſo ſevere and ridgid againſt ſin; O it is but a ſaying, Lord have mercy upon us, and all will do well; now here is their miſtake about God, God is exceeding holy, and he is wonderful ſevere; Gods thoughts are not as our thoughts; A man judges well of himſelf, but God will ſend him to Hell for judging well of himſelf; the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all unrighteouſneſs, the very appearances of evil; God hath cut off men for ſmall ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is from peoples miſtakes about the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the inſufficiency of the Creature; they do not ſee an utter inſufficiency in all Creatures to releeve them, and therefore they ſtick upon Creatures. One man hee truſts unto his eſtate, and riches, the rich mans wealth is his ſtrong tower; Another man reſts upon his Wiſdom, and policy; another truſts to his Strength, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truſts to his Almes and good Works; and another thinks he ſhall never dye, he is not ſo old but he may yet live another Month, or a Year; men are not convinced of the inſufficiency of all things to releeve them, and deliver them, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; but if they were ſatisfied, no Angel, nor Potentate, no Action of their own, no action of others, not all the Saints in the VVorld can deliver one Soul; Then
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108127:65"/>they would hunger and thirſt after Chriſt, but while they are not convinced of the inſufficiency of all theſe things, there is no thirſting after Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Further, This is from their not underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the infinite worth, and excellency, and good that is to be had in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt alone; they think they muſt joyn ſomething with Chriſt, I will do a little, and Chriſt ſhall do the reſt; they ſet up themſelves with Chriſt, and make themſelves equal to Chriſt, they muſt ſave themſelves in part, and Chriſt muſt ſave them in part; But now if men and women did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the excellency of Chriſt, the fulneſs of Chriſt, the grace of Chriſt, the mercy and love of Chriſt, and the vertue of Chriſt; how that the only way for pardon, for peace, for life, for ſtrength, for comfort, for whatſoever their Souls ſtand in need of, it is in Chriſt, then they would be carried out to Chriſt — Is not he held out in the Goſpel to be a Sun, all Light in him? — Is not he held out to have life in himſelf, all Spiritual life in him? <hi>I am come that yee might have life, and have it in more abundance</hi> — Is not Chriſt held out to be the great High Prieſt, that offered himſelf a Sacrifice, and ſuch a Sacrifice that all other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices have ceaſed? all lies upon Chriſt, and whatſoever your ſins are, whatſoever your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs and Poverty is, there is relief to bee had in Chriſt, hee is Righteouſneſs, hee is Strength, he is Bread, he is all; ſo that peoples not well underſtanding the worth of Chriſt, and all to be had in Chriſt, for the Lord hath ſealed him, ſent him, ſet him forth, and declared, <hi>There
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108127:65"/>is no name under Heaven by which you can have Salvation, but Chriſt;</hi> it is not in the Spirit of God, but in Chriſt, who ſends the Spirit; the very Spirit comes from Chriſt, ſo that all is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in him.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And laſtly, Peoples not hungering and thirſting after Chriſt Spiritually, is from hence, that they look upon the Doctrin and Diſcipline of Chriſt as unſuitable to them; Chriſts Doctrin is a hard Doctrin, a ſevere Doctrin, Chriſts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline and Government they will not be under, to bear his yoke they will not indure it; what? for a yoke to come upon their necks, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable; what, muſt I give up my ſelf to Chriſt, and follow Chriſt? fare-well all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, all pleaſures, and all delights; now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſts Diſcipline and Doctrin is croſs to fleſh and bloud, therefore they do not Spiritually deſire Chriſt; ſo then there are but few Spiritual thirſters, and you ſee whence it is that there are ſo few.</p>
               <p>The next uſe is a uſe of Examination, that we would examine our ſelves whether we be Spiritual Thirſters yea or no, that ſo wee may have this ſweet invitation of Chriſt, <hi>Let him that is athirſt come;</hi> Chriſt will ſay to thy Soul come, come; now I ſay, let us examine, and make inquiry whether we be Spiritual thirſters yea or no.</p>
               <p>But before I come to the diſcovery of it, let me tell yee, there is a falſe thirſt, and there is a true thirſt — The true thirſt doth ariſe from the ſenſe and feeling of want of moyſture throughout the whole man, the falſe is accidental; the one is Natural, the other is Accidental; Accidental

               <p>So now in his Spiritual thirſting; a true thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth ariſe from a defire of union with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, through a general ſenſe of ſin; and the falſe thirſt doth ariſe either from appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>My Soul thirſteth after God,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> but now in another it is a partial thirſt, his Conſcience it may be akes, and he thirſts now for Chriſt to releeve his Conſcience, and if guilt be taken away he is well; or it may be he is athirſt in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he thirſts for ſome more light, becauſe he ſees ſome errour in ſome way; or he would have more parts and gifts, and ſo it is a partial thirſt; but if it be a true Spiritual thirſt, it is a thirſt of the whole Soul, the Conſcience thirſts, and would have the Bloud of Chriſt to ſprinkle it: the Underſtanding thirſts, and would have the knowledge of Chriſt compleated in it; it is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal thirſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 You may diſtinguiſh the true Spiritual thirſt from the falſe one, from the riſe of the thirſt; both theſe thirſts may ariſe from the ſame cauſe, yet have a differing way; the true thirſt ariſes from ſin, and ſo doth the other, but under ſeveral Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</p>
               <p n="1">1 Hee that doth truly thirſt after Chriſt, his thirſt riſes firſt from the pollution —</p>
               <p n="2">2 From the ſeparation ſin makes — And,</p>
               <p n="3">3 From the offence ſin gives.—</p>
               <p n="1">1 It riſes from the pollution of ſin; ſin he ſees hath ſo defiled the Soul, ſo defiled the whole man, that he is unmeet for God, unmeet for all that are Spiritual, and now becauſe hee is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, ſo beſooted and beſmeared with the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, his Soul thirſts after the Bloud of Chriſt, after the Spirit of God, and Chriſt, his thirſt riſes from the conſideration of the pollution of ſin. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2 From the conſideration of the ſeparation ſin
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108127:67"/>hath made; this ſin, this ſin hath made a breach between God and my Soul, and ſeparated mee from God, who is the infinite good, the only good; O it hath put me in a great diſtance from God, and therefore thirſts to have communion with God again.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It riſes from the offence; O it hath cauſed God to frown, God to be angry; now his thirſt riſes from theſe, and therefore hee thirſts after Chriſt. But another now, his thirſt riſes from the conſequence of Sin; O, Sin will Damn me, it will bring Plagues and Judgements, ſin will make me lye roaring in Hell for ever, ſin brings ſhame upon me, &amp; the like ſo that this man thirſts after Chriſt upon this account: I deſire Chriſt that this puniſhment may be taken away, that I may be kept out of Hell, and the like; and that I may not be aſhamed; ſo that the thirſt ariſes from ſin, but upon theſe grounds and conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Again, we may diſtinguiſh between theſe thirſts, by the conſideration of what is thirſted after, as well as what the thirſt ariſes from — where the true thirſt is, it doth thirſt after Grace, after Holineſs, after Communion with God, after the excellencies of God, and Chriſt: mark — where the falſe thirſt is, it is after pardon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter peace, and after eaſe, ſo I may be pardoned, and ſaved, and have peace and eaſe, ſaith the Soul, that is all I look after, this is a falſe thirſt: but where the thirſt is true, it thirſts after Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Grace, and Communion with God, and the excellencies of God, and ſo to be healed as wel as ſaved; ſaith <hi>David, Heal my Soul, for I have ſinned againſt thee: My Soul is athirſt,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:108127:67"/>he, <hi>Lord heal my Soul;</hi> why it is not pardon heals the Soul, nor peace heals the Soul, but it is Grace and Holineſs heals the Soul, that makes you like to God, that makes you ſuch as you ſhould be. Now another man, he cares not for Holineſs, nor for Grace, he would have pardon, eaſe, peace, and Salvation; but as for Holineſs, Grace, and Communion with God, theſe things are laid aſide; but here is the difference between them, the true thirſt carries thee unto Grace, Holineſs, and Communion with God, and makes you look at the excellencies of God, whereas the other look for peace, eaſe, Salvation, and the like. Now it is true, that men and women who look at Grace, Holineſs, and Communion with God, ſhall have pardon, peace, and Salvation, but theſe are as Conſequences; Lord, ſaith the Soul, rather make me holy than pardon me, for if I be not holy what ſhall I do in Heaven? if I be holy, I cannot miſcarry in Hell; a holy Soul ſhall never feel pain though it be in Hell, and a corrupt Soul ſhall never finde joy though it be in Heaven; ſo that in this there lies a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>

                  </gap>al thirſt.</note> as the Natural thirſt makes a man or woman to faint, as in <hi>Judges</hi> 15.19. it is ſaid there of <hi>Sampſon</hi> that he drank, and revived, and his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit came again; his ſpirit was gone, he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to faint, his thirſt was ſuch that it brought him low; and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.5. <hi>Hungry and thirſty, their ſouls fainted in them;</hi> they were very feeble, they were brought low with hunger and thirſt; and where there is this Spiritual thirſt the Soul is brought low, it is ready to faint, as the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles, Tell him that I am ſick of love;</hi> O my deſires are ſuch after Chriſt, and after my Beloved, that I am ſick of Love, I
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108127:68"/>am ready to faint. And ſo <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 42. his Soul panted and thirſted after God, as the Hart when it is long hunted, wearied, and dry, pants after the water Brooks: ſo a Soul that hath a Spiritual thirſt, it is ready to faint with longing after God, with longing after Chriſt, with deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Grace, and the incomes of his Spirit, the light of his Countenance, communion with God in Chriſt, this is one effect of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This thirſt will cauſe men to ſtir, and to ſeek out; when men are truly and thorowly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſt they will ſeek out for drink; a man that is thorowly athirſt, he will out of his Bed at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and down to the Seller, and get drink to quench his thirſt; when men are athirſt, they will run to this Brook, and to that Brook for water; thoſe in <hi>Judg.</hi> 7. they down on their knees and lapt water. Men at Sea, what ſhifts will they make to get a little water when they are dry? ſo the Soul that is athirſt will not ſit ſtill, but ſeek out, it will ſeek for Brooks and Fountains, it will run to every Ordinance, to every Promiſe, run unto Chriſt, look up to God; If there bee any means of Grace in a Land, it will finde the ſame out; if the Viſion be never ſo rare, the Word never ſo precious, it will look out after it; a Soul that is thirſty, it will ſeek abroad, it will not bee reſtrained and kept within bounds, that is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Spiritual thirſt; when their deſires were a little ſtirred at Chriſts coming, how did they flock after Chriſt, and continued with him nights and days? <hi>You have beon with me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt <hi>theſe two or three days;</hi> and he works a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle now to ſatisfie them, that they might not faint
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:108127:69"/>in going home; ſo all night did they ſit there with <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee preacht the Goſpel, that they might drink large drafts of that heavenly Doctin; a Soul that is athirſt will ſeek out for releef.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Again, Where there is true thirſt, there men will part with any thing for to releeve their thirſt, hungry and thirſty men wil part with any thing for thoſe neceſſaries which Nature requires; when <hi>Hagar</hi> ſaw the Bottle empty, and the Childe ready to periſh, the water was ſpent in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ſhe caſts the Childe under one of the ſhrubs, and ſhe went and ſate her down over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, a good way off, as it were a Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, for ſhe ſaid, <hi>Let me not ſee the death of the Childe,</hi> and ſhe ſate over againſt him, and lift up her voyce and wept — What would <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> have given for a Bottle of water, for a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of bread? and when her eyes were open to ſee the Well, how it did rejoyce her that a Well was near her — And <hi>Eſau,</hi> when hee was hungry and thirſty, he gives away his Birth-right, hee ſells that for a little Pottage, and for Drink, hee gives any thing to releeve and help him in that caſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. <hi>Then</hi> Jacob <hi>gave</hi> Eſau <hi>bread, and pottage of Lintals, and he ſold his birth-right unto</hi> Jacob <hi>for it.</hi> So in this Spiritual thirſt, men will part with any thing to have this Spiritual thirſt ſatisfied, they will accept of Chriſt upon his own terms, they will pluck out a right eye, cut off a right hand, or a right foot, part with their deereſt luſts now, to have the thirſt of their Souls quenched. The young-man that came to Chriſt, <hi>Good Maſter, what ſhall I do to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite eternal life?</hi> It was a falſe thirſt in him;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:108127:69"/>ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Go and ſell all that thou haſt, and give to the poor: and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven.</hi> Now, had his thirſt been true, hee would have parted with his riches for Chriſt; the Diſciples parted with all, <hi>Maſter, we have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all and followed thee;</hi> the Soul that is truly athirſt wil let all go to have its thirſtſatisfied, <hi>How can yee beleeve</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>when yee ſeek honour one of another?</hi> let go your honour, let go your pleaſures, let go the Creatures, &amp; ſeek honour of God alone; If men were athirſt after Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and Divine honours, they would let theſe things go; Spiritual thirſt will cauſe men to part with any thing.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Again, Thoſe that are truly thirſty, things that are bitter ſeem pleaſant unto them; that drink which is ſower and diſtaftful unto others, is wonderful ſweet and pleaſing unto them; <hi>Darius</hi> and his Nobles, when they were dry, drank pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle water, and thought that never any Wine was ſo pleaſant as that water was; unpleaſing things, and things untoothſome, will be very delightſome unto ſuch Souls; and where this Spiritual thirſt is, there is not any truth in all the Goſpel, though it ſeem never ſo ſevere, never ſo croſs to Nature, never ſo contrary to our wills, humours, and fancies, but we will drink it down; let a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow Chriſt; this will down with a man that is truly thirſty. A man to become a fool that he may be wiſe, this will down: the Goſpel hath many things in it, which to fleſh and bloud are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hard, unſavoury; but were we truly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Thirſters, and did thirſt after Chriſt, even the moſt bittereſt truths, and the tarteſt cup that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108127:70"/>Chriſt preſents to the Sons of Men, would bee drunk off by them, <hi>To the hungry Soul every bitter thing is ſweet;</hi> ſo, to the thirſty Soul e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very bitter thing is ſweet: for a man to love his enemies, to bleſs them that curſe him, to pray for them that perſecute him; to do good to them that hate him, this is very hard to fleſh and bloud; but a Soul that is athirſt after Chriſt, drinks down theſe truthes, and findes ſweetneſs in them.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Another effect of this Spiritual thirſt is this, That it doth extinguiſh in a great meaſure (if not wholly) the thirſt after other things; it doth extinguiſh all ſinful thirſt, and doth correct and moderate all other thirſts, thirſting after the Creature; you know, the light and heat of the Sun puts out the light and heat of the fire, and doth abate it in a great meaſure when the Sun ſhines upon it, ſo where this thirſt comes after Spiritual things, and is in truth, it doth abate and extinguiſh the thirſt after unlawful things, and doth abate very much your deſires after other things; ſaith Chriſt unto the Woman, in <hi>John</hi> 4.14. <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt;</hi> ſhall never thirſt as he had done before, ſhall never have ſuch ſtrong deſires after Creatures; ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Philippians;</hi> thoſe things which before ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med goodly and excellent, and were great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and prerogatives to him, ſaith he, <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all loſs and dung now, for the excellencie of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> I have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thirſt begotten in me now, and this thirſt hath abated my thirſt to the World, my deſires
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108127:70"/>after Creatures, and delights in them, I have a thirſt that carries me after more high and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things than they are; ſo in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world;</hi> I thirſt no more after the world, ſaith he, it is Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified to me, and I am Crucified to it, it is Chriſt I thirſt after, to know the power of his Death and Reſurrection, to know Chriſt more; this did abate and cool his deſire and affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all externals, and the glory of the world.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Again, where this Spiritual thirſt is, the more you drink the more it is increaſed, and this ſeems ſtrange; where this thirſt is; other thirſts are aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but this increaſes, the more you drink ſtill the more you thirſt; the more Grace any man retains, the more eager after Grace ſtill, the more thirſty after Chriſt this day, the more the next; this thirſt begets thirſt, it makes a man to ſee his need of Chriſt more, and of Grace, and God, and of Spiritual things more and more, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges his deſire. As Lime, when you throw water upon it, it makes the Lime burn the more; ſo when the Soul thirſts, and God gives it water of life, it thirſts more, therefore ſaith God, <hi>Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> In time God will fill it, but Grace doth ſtretch our deſires, and makes men more vigorous in purſuit of heavenly things than over before; that man or woman that can ſit down content with a little knowledge, with a little meaſure of Grace, with a little degree of Faith, with a little portion of the Spirit, that man
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108127:71"/>in truth hath none, for it is the nature of Grace to make more hungry, more thirſty, more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, it will draw out the Soul more ſtrongly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt; the Spouſe was never ſo affected with Chriſt, as after ſhe had taſted of the love of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Again, Where this thirſt is in truth, it breeds in the Soul a conformity to the thirſt that is in God, and in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why? are they thirſty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, God himſelf is thirſty, and Chriſt is thirſty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.13. <hi>O that my people had harkened unto me, and Iſrael had walked in my way;</hi> Here is Gods thirſt, <hi>O that there were ſuch a heart in this people,</hi> ſaith God, where there is a true Spiritual thirſt, there is a conformity in the heart unto God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.5. ſaith <hi>David</hi> there who had this thirſt, <hi>O that my ways were directed to keep thy ſtatutes;</hi> Lord, this is thy deſire that men ſhould keep thy Statutes; Lord, this is my deſire, <hi>O that I could keep thy ſtatutes.</hi> Here is a conformity now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Soul that is athirſt; ſaith God in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. <hi>Seek yee my face,</hi> my heart an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſaith <hi>David, thy face Lord will I ſeek.</hi> Here is a conformity between Gods deſire and mans deſire; ſo in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> ſaith the Spouſe there, <hi>My beloved is mine, and his deſire is towards me.</hi> And in another place, <hi>I am my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds, and my Beloved is mine.</hi> Doth Chriſt deſire me? why I deſire Chriſt, ſaith the Spouſe; ſo that this Spiritual thirſt breeds a conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the heart and God, that look what God deſires it deſires.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:108127:71"/> 8 Again, This Spiritual thirſt doth cauſe men to thirſt after God for himſelf, and Chriſt for himſelf; many do thirſt after God, not for himſelf, but for themſelves; they thirſt after the Loaves, they thirſt after the Gifts of God, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeek to be in great Services, to bee in great mens Houſes, and Courts, that they may have their Livery, that they may eat and drink of the beſt, that they may live at eaſe, and not out of love to the Perſon; <hi>Shimei</hi> comes to <hi>David,</hi> and to <hi>Solomon,</hi> but not out of love to <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> but to ſave his life; ſo many come to God, that they may be ſaved from Hell, and Damnation, but they would live in their luſts, have their wills, have their eaſe, and bear Gods Livery, ſome outward profeſſion, but they come not to God for love of God, for love of Holineſs, for love of Truth, for love of Jeſus Chriſt, it is for themſelves, but not for Gods Self; but this Soul that is truly athirſt muſt have God himſelf, and for himſelf, he knows all other things will come in after; If I have God, I have all, if I have not God, I have nothing will do me good.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Laſtly, Where this true Spiritual thirſt is, it is that a man may be ſatisfied; and that a man may be fruitful, as the earth; why is the Earth dry, and thirſteth after the Rain, and gapes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as if it would ſwallow up the very Heavens? that it may bee ſatisfied with the Rain, and bee much fruitful; ſo a Soul that hath this Spiritual thirſt, deſires to receive from God, that ſo it may be fruitful; O it cannot bring forth good fruit, and that is a burthen to it; and it longs to bee
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:108127:72"/>fruitful, and thirſts to receive ſome influences of Grace, ſome dews from Heaven, that ſo being watered, and moyſtned, it may grow and yeeld good fruit; and thus you ſee ſome effects and fruits of this Spiritual thirſt, and ſo to know the truth of it, whether you have this thirſt or no.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Here now a Queſtion may ariſe; may ſome ſay, I do not finde this thirſt in my Soul, I do not finde ſuch a thirſt as here is mentioned in my Soul, and what ſhall I think of my ſelf? others, it may be they have ſtrong thirſtings, and ſuch deſires, but as for my ſelf, I do not finde the ſame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this I anſwer, that there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in men in regard of this Spiritual thirſt, as well as in men in regard of Natural thirſt; ſome bodies are more thirſty than others, your Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick bodies are more thirſty than Flegmatick, &amp; ſo ſome Chriſtians are more thirſty than others; ſome have lived very profane lives, in ſcandalous courſes, and run out into exorbitant ways, and greatly have diſhonoured God, and if God ever ſtir in their hearts, and bring them to thirſt, their thirſt will be vehement, their thirſt will be affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, their thirſt will bee ſtronger than other mens; ſome they are trained up from the Cradle in the ways of God, they have more ingenuous Natures, and breaks not out into ſuch ill ways, and their thirſt is more moderate, and leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, — it is not the degree of the thirſt, but the truth of the thirſt that is required; though you have not a ſtrong thirſt, yet you have a true thirſt; as it is not a ſtrong faith, but a true faith that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to Salvation. Now the degree of thirſt,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108127:72"/>which will bring you to Chriſt, which will make you come and drink, and ſtay with Chriſt, that is ſufficient.</p>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108127:82"/>to me except the Father which hath ſent me draw him;</hi> Gods drawing in the 65 <hi>v:</hi> is ſaid to be Gods gift: <hi>Therefore ſaid I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of the Father:</hi> that is, unleſs God doth give him power to come to me, to beleive in me: So that the Fathers drawing, is putting in that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power into a thirſty ſoule as to cloſe with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But then it will be ſaid, ſurely theſe Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in vaine, if a man cannot come when he is Invited, to what end are they?</p>
            <p>The Sun ſhines upon the Rock, and the raine falls upon the Rocks, yet no man lookes that the Sun ſhould melt the Rocks, or the raine ſhould make the Rocks fruitfull; But the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent parts and feilds have the benefit; and ſo, though Invitations fall upon Rocks, yet the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent perſons, other perſons may have the benefit.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, Generally in theſe Invitations the Lord doth convey this power, the Lord doth worke this Faith in their ſoules, and gives them this power to cloſe with Chriſt: <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi> together with the Invitation, the power was given to <hi>Lazarus</hi> to come forth. You have an obſervable place in the 2 <hi>Ezek:</hi> 1. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, Son of Man, ſtand upon thy feete, and I will ſpeake unto thee:</hi> marke, <hi>And the Spirit entered in to me when he ſpake unto me, and ſet me upon my feete. Ezekiel</hi> was ſmitten ſo downe with the ſight of Glory, that he was not able to riſe; Now, ſaith he, Son of man ſtand upon thy feete, but he could not ſtand up: But the Spirit entered into me when he ſpake unto
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:108127:82"/>me, ſaith <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and ſet me upon my feete:— So when Chriſt ſaith here, <hi>come,</hi> with Chriſts ſpeaking, the Spirit may be, and is many times conveyed and cauſes a man to come: There is that life, that Grace communicated to the ſoule, together with the Invitation, as makes a man to doe the thing, and inables him thereunto: ſo that Invitations are not in vaine: and ſo much for opening of the word <hi>come:</hi> — The poynt that I ſhall commend unto you is this.</p>
            <p>Doct: 1. <hi>That the Lord Chriſt is very deſirous that ſinners, thirſty ſinners ſhould come to him for releife, that they ſhould be ſaved, that they ſhould have refreſhing virtue from him, Grace, pardon, peace, and whatſoever will doe their ſoules good. Let him that is athirſt come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now becauſe it lies in the hearts of all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to queſtion the willingneſs of God and Chriſt to ſave them, and to doe them good; Therefore I ſhall inſiſt the more upon this and make it out fully to you.</p>
            <p>You know the Leper in the Goſpel ſaid, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter if thou wilt thou canſt make me cleane:</hi> I know thou haſt power, but if thou <hi>wilt,</hi> there lies the ſticke, and here lies that which ſticks with ſinners, to queſtion the willingneſs of God and Chriſt: Now the Lord Chriſt is very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that ſinners ſhould come unto him; and this I ſhall make out ſeverall wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Of Chriſts willingnes for ſinners to come unto him.</note> from the Conſideration of Chriſts lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe his greatneſs, and his Glory, which would dant and diſcourage ſinners, when one appeares in majeſtie; when a Judge comes into the Country with his greatneſs, it makes your Delinquents and Malifactors afraid; But now
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108127:83"/>Chriſt lays downe his Majeſtie, and his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Glory, and whatſoever is dreadfull and terrible unto us. <hi>Joh:</hi> 17.5. <hi>And now ô Father, Glorifie thou me, with thine owne ſelfe, with the Glory which I had with thee before the world was;</hi> Chriſt had laid aſide his Glory when he came downe into the world, &amp; he came in the forme of a ſervant, in a meane and low condition; When a Prince ſhall lay aſide his greatneſs, and come and converſe with beggars and ſinners, then they can the more freely come unto him, and ſpeake to him: the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath laid aſide his Glory and greatneſs, and came and converſt with finners here in the world, which is a great Argument that he was willing to doe ſinners good, that they ſhould come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him and be ſav'd by him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider how the Lord Chriſt hath fitted himſelfe to releive ſinners, Chriſt hath indured a great deale of hardſhip, ſuffered heavie things, he trod the wine-preſs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wrath alone. You know Corne that makes bread and drinke, indures the heate &amp; the cold, indures the ſlale, and the Mill to be Ground, and ſo the bread and the drinke are made thereof.</p>
            <p>The Lord Chriſt hath indured all that the Father required of him, that ſo he might be bread of life, and water of life to us, he hath ſuffered bitter things, an accurſed death: in the 12th of <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I have a Baptiſme to be baptized with, and how am I ſtreightened till it be accompliſhed?</hi> I have a Baptiſme of Blood to be baptized with, and how am I ſtreightened till it be accompliſhed? I thirſt to lay downe my
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:108127:83"/>blood that it may be drinke for the world, as much as any in the world doe thirſt for my blood, and to drinke of that; I and more then all the world. The Lord Jeſus hath ſuffered Circumciſion, hee hath ſuffered whipping, crowning with Thornes, ſpitting upon, reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, revilings, curſing, ſuffered the diſpleaſure of his Father, diſſertions, temptations by Satan, ſuffered Death, and all that he might be fit, and fitted to ſave us, that he might be bread for us, and drinke for us, releife for us; Is not Chriſt willing thinke you now, that you ſhould eate of his fleſh, and drinke of his blood, that you ſhould come to him, and have the benefit of his ſufferings? <hi>I am ſtreightened,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>till it be accompliſhed; I thirſt,</hi> ſaith Chriſt upon the Croſſe, and now its finiſhed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From the very end of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is evident that Chriſt is very willing and deſirous that ſinners ſhould come unto him, and be ſaved by him, and be refreſht by him: what was the ends of Chriſts coming, <hi>Mat:</hi> 18.11. <hi>For the Son of man is come to ſave that which was loſt:</hi> were not all loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> are not all ſinners, are not all under the curſe of the Law, are not all children of wrath by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are not all enemies of God through wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed workes in their mindes? The end now of Chriſts coming was to ſave that which was loſt: and in <hi>Luk:</hi> 10.10 you have it more fully; <hi>For the Son of man is come to ſeeke and to ſave that which is loſt:</hi> It might have been ſaid, It's true, Chriſt will ſave that which is loſt, if it will come to him; I but Chriſt is come to <hi>ſeeke out them,</hi> to ſeeke and to ſave that which is loſt;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:108127:84"/>this is the good Shepherd that goes and ſeekes out the loſt ſheepe, and takes it up upon his ſhoulders &amp; brings it home: A Shepherd when his ſheepe are ſcattered, ſome in one lane, ſome upon one common, ſome in one feild, ſome in another, he goes and ſeekes out the ſheepe and brings them home: ſo the Lord Chriſt came for that very end, to ſeeke out, and to ſave that which was loſt; art thou a poore thirſty, ſinfull ſoule, art thou loſt in thine owne apprehenſion, art thou at the gates of death and hell, the Lord Chriſt came to ſave thee, and ſeeke out thee, he is willing, forward, ready to doe it, he came for that very end.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Chriſts willingneſs and readineſs to this worke will appeare, if you conſider the Cures that he wrought when he was here in the world; did not Chriſt heale all diſeaſes, the blinde, the lame, the ſicke, the dumb, the deafe, the poſſeſt with Devills? did not Chriſt ſhew compaſſion towards them all and heale them; <hi>Mark:</hi> 4.23. <hi>And Jeſus went about all Galile, teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Goſpel of the kingdome, and healing all manner of ſickneſs, and all manner of diſeaſes among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; And his fame went through all Syria, and they brought unto him all ſicke people that were taken with divers diſeaſes and torments, and thoſe which were poſſeſt with Devills, and thoſe which were Lunatick, and thoſe which had the Palſie, and he healed them.</hi> Is not Chriſt willing and ready to doe good to ſinners, he doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them to come to him, let the diſeaſe be what it will, and the party diſeaſed be what he will:-And its conceived when Chriſt heald their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:108127:84"/>he heald their ſoules too, Chriſt heald <hi>all</hi> diſeaſes. In <hi>Math:</hi> 8. you have two or three remarkeable paſſages; there comes a Leper to Chriſt, and ſaith, <hi>Lord if thou wilt, thou canſt make me cleane;</hi> he did not come beleivingly, but he came doubtingly to Chriſt; and what followes; <hi>Jeſus put forth his hand and touched him, ſaying, I will, be thou cleane;</hi> why doeſt thou queſtion my <hi>will,</hi> ſaith Chriſt I am more willing to heale thee then thou art deſirous of it, <hi>I will,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be thou cleane;</hi> here Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhews his willingneſs, and cures the man with a word; with a word and a touch he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him.</p>
            <p>Then afterwards in the Chapter, there comes a Centurion to him, and ſollicits him for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and ſaith, <hi>Maſter ſpeake the word onely, and my ſervant ſhall be healed:</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I have not found ſo great Faith, no not in Iſrael, as in this Centurion:</hi> and <hi>v:</hi> 12. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Goe thy way, and as thou haſt beleived, ſo be it unto thee;</hi> here Chriſt heales one with a word.</p>
            <p>And then thirdly, he comes to <hi>Peters</hi> houſe, and there his wives mother lay ſicke of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and he touched her hand, and the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour leſt her. Chriſt did but touch her hand, and ſayes nothing, and the Feavour left her: Chriſt is willing to cure ſinners, and he can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily doe it, with a word, or a word and a touch, or a touch onely.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is ſo forward, that before it is deſired he doth it: In <hi>John</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 6. when Jeſus ſaw the impotent man lie there, and knew that he had been now a long time in that caſe, he ſaith unto him, <hi>wilt thou be made whole?</hi> The man did not
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:108127:85"/>aske him the Queſtion, Lord wilt thou heale me; But Chriſt comes and finds him out, and ſaith, Man wilt thou be made whole; ô Sir, I have none to put me in, when the Angel ſtirres another ſteps in before me, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Take up thy bed, and walke.</hi> Chriſt aske him the Queſtion, prevents him, and heales him: Oh! Chriſt is willing to doe ſinners good, &amp; to ſave ſinners.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, This appeares from the Command of Chriſt, when a thing is commanded, thoſe that command would faine have it done; now the Lord Chriſt commands men to come unto him, commands them to beleive: <hi>Joh:</hi> 14.1. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, ye beleive in God, beleive alſo in me.</hi> Beleive in me, there's eaſe, there's reſt, there's refreſhing, there's delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, there's ſalvation for you: Beleive in me: and in the 1 <hi>Joh:</hi> 3. latter end; <hi>This is his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement that we ſhould beleive in the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Father that we ſhould beleive on the name of his Son, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and this is the Commandement of the Son that we ſhould beleive in him When the Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Son to goe to the Vineyard and digg there; the Father was very willing the child ſhould goe and doe it: And ſo when God the Father, and Chriſt the Son, commands us to beleive, they are very willing wee ſhould. When Princes ſend out their Commands to the people to doe ſuch and ſuch things, they are very deſirous they ſhould be done: So when God gives out his Commands in the Goſpel, and Chriſt commands in the Goſpel to come,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108127:85"/>come, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Let him that is athirſt come;</hi> I command you to beleive; It's an argument there is a ſtrong will in him for it.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Doth not Chriſt ſweetly invite you, uſe ſweete Invitations and allurements to draw ſinners to him, can there be more ſweete Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, then what you have from Chriſt upon this account: in the 11th of <hi>Math:</hi> 28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavie laden, and I will give you reſt:</hi> oh! you poore ſinners of the world, you poore ſinners of the earth, you that travell under the burden of your ſins, you that are heavie laden, you that are ready to ſinke into hell through feare of wrath, come unto me, come unto me; he doth not ſay why have you broken <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, why have you offended my Father, why have you liv'd ſo baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vilely? no, come unto me you that are weary and heavie laden, you that are ready to ſinke and periſh, and are hungry and thirſty, and know not which way to turne your ſelves now for releife, come unto me.</p>
            <p>So in the 55 of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſee what a bleſſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation there is, <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eate, come buy wine and milke without money, and without price: Wherefore doe you lay out your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not; hearken diligently unto me, and eate ye that which is good, and let your ſoule delight it ſelfe in fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> Is not here a ſweete, a gracious, a bleſſed Invitation now to poore ſinners, unto ſuch as we are here this day: The Lord Chriſt is a ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto you this day, Ho every one, every one<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108127:86"/>that thirſteth, young or old, rich or poore, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or unlearned, of whatſoever condition you be, are you athirſt, would you have mercy, peace, grace, the Spirit of Chriſt, would you have any thing to doe your ſoules good, come, come unto me, <hi>Come unto the waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I but I have no money; It matters not, come without money, come here's wine, here's milke, and here's bread, and marrow, and fattneſs, here's that will make your ſoules live, here's vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in Chriſt to make your ſoules live for ever. So in the 23 <hi>Pro:</hi> 26. <hi>My ſon give me thy heart;</hi> ô my ſon, ſaith God, give me thy heart; Chriſt is the Everlaſting Father, and he ſaith, my ſon, give me thy heart, come to me. One place more in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>Revelation</hi> is worth your obſerving; <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the doore and knock, if any man heare my voyce and open the doore, I will come in to him and will ſup with him, and he with mee:</hi> Behold I ſtand at the doore and knock; I came downe from heaven into mine Ordinances, I knock at the doore of your hearts and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, if any man will open now, if any man would have water of life from me, if any man would have bread of life from me, if any man would have communion with me, let him but open and receive me in, and I will ſup with him and he with mee: what ſweete Invitations have wee from Chriſt, how forward, how ready is the Lord Jeſus to doe poore ſinners good.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, This appeares in that the Lord Chriſt hath Inſtituted and appointed his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, his Meſſengers, his Miniſters, and ſent them to wooe, intreate, beſeech, and to draw men in unto him: The Lord hath ſet up in the Church
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:108127:86"/>Officers purpoſely to make known his forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and readineſs to receive ſinners, and to goe forth in his Name, and to get them to come in to Chriſt; 'Tis our worke to beſeech you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to intreate you to hearken to the Lord Chriſt, to come in to him, to come and taſt of his dainties, to receive righteouſneſſe, grace, ſtrength, ſalvation, to receive pardon; this is our worke, to get men in to Chriſt, to fetch you in to the Fould. In the 14 of <hi>Luke</hi> 16. <hi>A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine man made a great Supper, and bad many; and ſent his ſervants at Supper time to ſay unto them that were bidden, Come for all things are now ready:</hi> Chriſt is the great Man, and hee makes a Supper in the time of the Goſpel, and he ſends out his ſervants, he ſends out the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to Invite, and call men, ſaying, Supper is ready, and all things are ready. Chriſt hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied Divine Juſtice, Chriſt hath laid downe his life, and ſhed his blood, he is riſen from the dead, he hath overcome the world, overcome the Devill, hath opened heaven, all things are ready for you to feede upon, ô come; <hi>But they all made excuſe; Then the Maſter of the houſe being angery, ſaid to his ſervants, goe out quickly into the ſtreets and lanes of the Citie, and bring in hither the poore, and the maimed, the halt, and the blinde; and the ſervants ſaid, Lord it is done as thou haſt commanded, and yet there is roome: and the Lord ſaid unto the ſervants, goe out into the high wayes, and hedges, and compell them to come in, that my houſe may be filled.</hi> Goe ye (ſaith he) my Apoſtles, my Diſciples, my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, my Servants, goe fetch in men and women from high wayes and hedges, from lanes and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108127:87"/>ſtreets, &amp; from all parts; ô bring them in to the Goſpel, bring them into my houſe, bring them into the kingdome of heaven, tell them of the dainties there, tell them of their danger abroad. This is the great worke now of the Miniſtry: which is a cleere demonſtration that the Lord Chriſt would have ſinners ſaved, he would have his houſe filled, he ſtands not upon what they be, let them be blinde, maimed, naked, poore, wounded, bring them in ſaith Chriſt, let them taſt of the dainties of the Goſpel, let them heare of mercy through me, of pardon and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs through me: — So in the 9 <hi>Pro: Wiſdome hath builded her houſe, ſhe hath hewn her out ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven pillars, ſhe hath killed her beaſts, ſhe hath mingled her wine, ſhe hath alſo furniſhed her ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhe hath ſent forth her maidens, ſhe cryeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the higheſt places of the Citie, who ſo is ſimple let him come in hither, as for him that lacketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſhe ſaith to him, come eate of my bread, and drinke of the wine that I have mingled: For ſake the fooliſh and live, and goe in the way of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding:</hi> — This is ſpoken of Chriſt, and the times of the Goſpel, and the Miniſters are ſaid to be maidens, who are ſent forth to allure and to draw poore ſoules in to Jeſus Chriſt. So that the great worke of the Miniſtry is to make knowne the willingneſs of Chriſt, and to bring ſinners unto Chriſt, that they may have mercy from him: — In the 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5.19, 20. <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelfe, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them: and hath committed unto us the word of Reconciliation; now then, wee are Ambaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray ye in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108127:87"/>Chriſts ſtead, be ye reconciled to God:</hi> Saith <hi>Paul</hi> I am an Ambaſſador of God, and God doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you by us, God doth beſeech ſinners, and therefore wee beſeech you ſaith he, we beſeech ye for the Lords ſake be ye reconciled to God, doe not ſtand out with God and Chriſt any longer, but come in to God, and come in to Chriſt, and ſo God will receive you, and Chriſt will receive you: God doth beſeech you by Miniſters, God doth intreat you. The Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was, <hi>Goe teach all Nations:</hi> he commands them for to teach <hi>all</hi> nations, to acquaint them with the riches of Grace by Chriſt, &amp; the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull love and kindneſs of God in Chriſt, and what's to be had by Chriſt, that people might come to him, and have mercy and releife from him.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, This willingneſs of Chriſt to doe ſinners good, will appeare yet further, in that he doth accept of the leaſt, and loweſt degrees of Faith, and will not diſcourage the weakeſt ſoule that comes unto him: <hi>Math:</hi> 12.20. <hi>A bruiſed reede ſhall he not breake, and ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench, till he ſend forth Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto victory:</hi> Chriſt will be very tender of a bruiſed reede, very tender of ſmoaking flax, he will not breake one, he will not quench the other he will not deale harſhly and roughly with them, but he will ſend forth Judgement unto victory: He will give them power over all their corruptions, over all their feares &amp; doubts: he will make them to judge all their Enemies, and be victorious over their Enemies. — So in the 45 <hi>Iſa:</hi> 22. <hi>Looke unto me and be ye ſaved all the ends of the earth:</hi> Looke unto me and be
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:108127:88"/>ſaved: If I have but a good looke from you, ſaith Chriſt, I will entertaine you: looke unto me but with the weakeſt eye of Faith, though it be a dim eye, be but halfe an eye, looke unto me and be ſaved: — In the 40 of <hi>Iſa:</hi> 11. <hi>He ſhall feede his Flocke like a Shepherd, he ſhall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lambs with his Armes, and carry them in his boſom, and ſhall Gently leade thoſe that are with young.</hi> See how tender the Lord Chriſt, the good Shepherd will be of thoſe that are weake; Hee will gather the Lambs with his Armes, as a Shepherd when he goes abroad, and a Lamb is newly yeaned, and it's weake and feeble, and the weather is cold and froſty, hee takes up the Lamb in his Armes, and carries it home, and gives it milke; So the Lord will deale by a poore weak feeble ſoule, he will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it in the Armes of his providence, in the Armes of his Spirit, in thoſe Everlaſting Armes of his that never faile, he will carry the Lambs in his boſom, and Gently leade thoſe that are with young: Thus will he deale with them: Hence he ſaith in the 14 <hi>Rom: Him that is weak in the Faith receive ye, but not to doubtfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations:</hi> Receive him that is weake in the Faith, if there be never ſo little Faith receive him, if there be but one dram of Faith receive him.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, The willingneſs of the Lord Chriſt to doe ſinners good appeares in this, That he ſhutts not up this water of Life, though he knowes but few will come unto him for it; and thoſe of them that doe come unto him, they doe oft abaſe it, and abaſe him too: People doe haſten more to the waters for their bodyes, to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:108127:88"/>the <hi>Bath, Epſum, Tunbridge,</hi> and to new drinkes that they have now, they flock to have theſe for the body, and can magnifie them, and ſpeak wonderfully well of them, but few come to Chriſt, and when they do come, they will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drinke, as I have told you before; they ſpeak evill of thoſe doctrines he gives them; theſe are hard ſayings. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe denies Chriſt his Maſter, denies him once, twice, thrice. Thus Chriſt is dealt withall by ſinners, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, Chriſt doth not ſhut up the water, nor lock up the water, but the waters ſtand open for any to come, let whoſoever will come, let him come and drinke of the waters of life freely. If Chriſt had not had a minde wee ſhould have theſe waters, he would have taken a courſe to deprive us of them, he could ſoone dry up the waters, dry up the Goſpel. But the waters are not dryed up, they are not taken from us, there is freedome for any to come, notwithſtanding they have abuſed the waters.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, It is ſtrong Evidence that the Lord Chriſt is willing to ſave ſinners, and to doe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners good, In that he is greived, troubled, and affected very much, that ſinners will not come to him for theſe waters; <hi>ô Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem;</hi> ſaith Chriſt, weeping over it, <hi>how oft would I have gathered thee as a hen doth her chickens, and ye would not: ô Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, that thou hadeſt knowne in this thy day the things that belong unto thy peace, but now they are hidden from thine eyes:</hi> — Chriſt is greived at the heart that men and women doe not come to him, though they have no money, though they have nothing to buy the water with, yet that they
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108127:89"/>will not come and fetch the water, Chriſt is greived and troubled at the very heart to ſee it: ô that theſe publick places ſhould be ſo empty upon a Lords day, ſo empty upon a week day: there's water of life, and none will come and drinke the water; how oft, how oft, may Chriſt ſay, would I have ſav'd ſuch a Towne, ſuch a Nation, ſuch a people, and they would not; Chriſt weepes over ſoules and familyes, and Cities.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, It's wonderfull perſpicuous and cleere, that Chriſt would doe ſinners good, in that he doth preſs them with the ſtrongeſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that can be, to pertake of the good is to be had by himſelfe: What promiſes doth he make, what evills doth he threaten? There are two great Arguments that doe prevaile with all the world, yet will not prevaile here, he ſetts liſe and death before men, If you will come here's <hi>life</hi> for you, if you will not come you are dead men: people will not keepe within doores when theſe are the Arguments, my life is at the ſtake, and if I goe I am a made man, if not I am a loſt man, an undone man. <hi>Why will ye dye ô houſe of Iſrael?</hi> I am not willing ye ſhould dye, why will ye dye, why will ye dye, turne unto me and live, come unto me and live. In the 55 of <hi>Iſa: Incline your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:108127:89"/>loved the world that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life:</hi> Here's life and death ſet before you, Come thou poore ſinner and beleive in the Lord Jeſus, cloſe with him, here's life for thee, everlaſting life for thee; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to doe it, there's everlaſting death for thee, thou ſhalt periſh, how peremptory is the Lord here. In the 16 <hi>Mark:</hi> 15, 16. <hi>Goe ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature, he that beleiveth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that beleiveth not ſhall be damned;</hi> how round is the Goſpel, he that beleiveth, he that comes to Chriſt, that's the meaning, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiveth ſhall be ſaved; ſaved from all his ſinne, ſaved from the power of death, ſaved from the wrath of God, ſaved from hell-fire, ſaved from the guilt of his owne Conſcience, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiveth ſhall be ſaved over and over and over, — <hi>he that beleiveth not ſhall be damned,</hi>—how doth he preſs men now to come to him? If there be any weight in heaven or hell, it's laid all upon this, your coming to Chriſt, or refuſing Chriſt; if you come to Chriſt, all heaven is yours, all the glory, all the joy, all the comfort, all the bleſſings, all the happineſs there is yours: If you will not come to Chriſt, all the terrors of hell are yours, all the darkneſs, all the mournings, all the howlings, all the gnaſhings of teeth, all the miſery there will be yours; Therefore ſee how willing the Lord Jeſus is, that ſinners ſhould come, and that they ſhould be ſaved.</p>

            <p n="12">12ly <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nother evidence of Chriſts wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to ſave ſinners that will come unto him is, The Lord doth venture and hazard the looſing many, by making knowne his free Grace and willingneſs to ſave ſinners, for when ſinners doe heare that Chriſt is willing to ſave them, and very deſirous alſo, many they abuſe his free grace, this rich mercy, this willingneſs of Chriſt to doe their ſoules good: If Chriſt be ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſay they, wee will ſtay a while, it will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice hereafter. In the 4th of <hi>Jude,</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>They turne Grace into wantonneſs,</hi> and thouſands of ſcorners turne Grace into wantonneſs; when they heare Chriſt dyed and ſhed his blood for ſinners, that he is willing ſinners ſhould come in, that he waites for them, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats, and preſſes them to come to him; they take advantage from hence to ſin more freely, to ſtay it out to the uttermoſt. And thus the Lord runs a hazard of looſing many, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king knowne the riches of his Grace, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his mercy and loving kindneſs, which ſhews there a very ſtrong deſire in Chriſt to ſave ſinners.</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, It is evident that Chriſt is very
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108127:91"/>deſirous of ſinners ſalvation, in that he takes ſinners when they are at the worſt of all, at the height of wickedneſs. If a Prince will take into his family thoſe that are ſick of the plague, of the Leproſie, and of the worſt diſeaſes, 'tis an argument he hath a minde to have them live in his family, and that he is deſirous of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he takes ſinners when they are at the very worſt; <hi>Saul</hi> he was at the height of his blaſphemy, at the height of murder, at the height of perſecution; and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me,</hi> thy blaſphemies rage, and perſecutions are come up to heaven; and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 1. he was a perſecutor, a blaſphemer, and an injurious perſon, but I obtained mercy, even when I was ſo great and notorious a ſinner, Chriſt came and tooke him in; it's an argument then that Chriſt is very deſirous of the ſalvation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that he will take ſinners when they are in the height of their wickedneſs. When the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall had run out from his fathers houſe, and had ſpent yeares in wicked practiſes, in whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, drunkenneſs, gameing, and running in the wayes of the world, when he had ſpent all, and ſpent himſelfe; now when he was in this height of wickedneſs, it pleaſes God and Chriſt to call him, to bring him home, and to receive him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: had not Chriſt been deſirous of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſinners, he might have ſhut the doore againſt the Prodigall, and ſaid, you ſhall never come in adores againe: had not the Father been deſrous for the Sons ſake to have ſav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d ſinners, he would not have entertain'd the Prodigall; there is not a velleitie but a ſtrong efficacious
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:108127:91"/>deſire in God and Chriſt to ſave ſinners. The <hi>Jewes</hi> when they were at the worſt, when they had put that innocent one to death, when they had ſaid, <hi>His blood be upon us and upon our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> when they had mockt him, reviled him, and accuſed him even after all this, Chriſt takes in many of them; three thouſand of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted at one Sermon by <hi>Peter; Him whom ye have Crucifyed with bloody hands hath God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;</hi> here is a cleere evidence of the earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Lord Jeſus to ſave ſinners; he takes them when they are at the worſt, when they have done the uttermoſt miſcheife &amp; ſpite they can againſt him, and againſt his wayes.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, It's an argument that the Lord Jeſus is very deſirous to ſave ſinners, If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider, that the Lord takes ſinners at the laſt caſt, at the end of their dayes, when they have no time left to ſerve him, he t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kes them at the very firſt intreaty and begging of mercy. The Theefe you know that had liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d wickedly all his dayes, when he came to the laſt caſt, and was upon the Laddar, or nail'd to the Croſſe, and ready to breath out his laſt breath, ſaith he, <hi>Lord remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me when thou comeſt into thy kingdome;</hi> Chriſt might have ſaid, Remember thee, why ſhould I remember thee, thou haſt bin a bloody wretch, a Theefe and a murderer all thy dayes, and thou deſerveſt nothing now but death and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and why ſhould I remember thee,, No, the Lord Chriſt ſaith not ſo but he ſaith, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> now when there was no time left for him to honour Chriſt, and to ſerve Chriſt, he onely now intreats this favour of him, being on the Croſſe, ſaith Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſt,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:108127:92"/>
               <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> And doubtleſs though we have but this one Inſtance, and ſo men ſhould not preſume to put off Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance till it be too late, yet I doe beleive, many a ſoule hath met with mercy, when they have been at the gates of death: I ſay, many a poore ſoule that hath been burdened with ſin, aſſlicted in Conſcience, and ready to ſinke, in the gates of death they have lookt up to Chriſt, and intreated him to remember them, &amp; Chriſt hath ſhewne them mercy, which ſhews the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and willingneſs of Chriſt to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Yet let not any preſume to doe ſo, for likely late Repentance is ſeldome true, a death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Repentance uſually is a dead Repentance, when feare of hell ſhall drive men to look after heaven, they may thanke hell for looking after God and Chriſt, but that by the way.</p>
            <p>Fiſteenthly and laſtly, It is cleerely evident that the Lord Chriſt hath a ſtrong Inclination to ſave ſinners, by his giving out of Scripture in that way and manner as he hath done; the Lord Chriſt hath given out Scripture ſo as to Anſwer the objections of men and women, to Anſwer all the eavills of their hearts, all the plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of corruption, and of a guilty Conſcience, and of the Devill himſelfe: The Lord hath given out Scripture ſo as to Anſwer all that might hinder their coming in unto him. In the 12 of <hi>Math: All manner of ſins and Blaſphemies ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given to the ſons of men:</hi> — What hath a ſinfull heart here to ſay, what canſt thou object againſt this? he tells thee, <hi>All manner</hi> of ſins ſhall be forgiven, all manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven, Are thy ſins beyond blaſphemy,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:108127:92"/>are they ſuch as come not within the compaſſe of <hi>all</hi> manner of ſin? Let thy ſins be ſlight or great, let them be old or new, let them be againſt Law, againſt Goſpel, againſt promiſes, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſins ſhall be forgiven: — Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The ſin againſt the Holy-Ghoſt ſhall not be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> But if thou have a heart to look to Chriſt for mercy, it's an argument thou art free from that ſin, for where that is, there's impenitency, there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s hardneſs of heart, no thinking of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance nor coming to God: <hi>But all manner of ſin and blaſphemies ſhall be forgiven:</hi> Is not here incouragement enough unto poore ſinners: — So here in the next words, <hi>Whoſoever will let him come and drinke of the water of life freely:</hi> It<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s laid downe ſo as to anſwer all your objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to take away all your plea's you have to ſtave you off from Chriſt. So then you ſee cleere evidences that Chriſt is willing to ſave ſinners.</p>
            <p>But why is Chriſt ſo willing to ſave ſinners?</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Why Chriſt is ſo willing to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</note> from his owne experience and ſence of what it is to be under the diſpleaſure of God, he was once tempted he was once forſaken, he cryed out in that condition, and he knew what the wrath and diſpleaſure of God meant: And now being full of compaſſion, he pitties all thoſe that are under the diſfavour of God; he knows ſinners have broken the Law, deſerved the curſe, the wrath of God, eternall death, and now his compaſſions being ſtirr'd within him, his Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els yearne, he deſires that ſinners may come to him; if any thirſt let him come, let him come, he ſhall be freed from the wrath of God, from the curſe of the Law, from guilt and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:108127:93"/>it's a ſad condition, I am ſenceable of it; I was in the ſhare and round of ſinners, and I know what it is to be in ſuch a condition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt is ſo deſirous, that ſo he may ſee of the travaile of his owne ſoule, and that men may ſee the end of his coming to ſave ſinners, was reall for if Chriſts end was to ſeeke and ſave that which was loſt, unleſſe he deſire and uſe meanes to ſave them, you may ſay it was not reall, therefore Chriſt to make it out that it was really his end, and that he might ſee of the travaile of his ſoule in ſuffering, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſinners may come in, he gives out the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, he appoynts Miniſters he invites them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, and ordinarily, he calls upon them and would have ſinners to come unto him to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, Chriſt doth this that ſo the freeneſſe of Gods Grace, and of his love may appeare and may be magnified, Chriſt is wonderfull deſirous that ſinners ſhould come in, and when they doe come in, they will mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the riches of Grace then they will ſtand and wonder at the Love of God, and of Chriſt, and that he ſhould waite upon the beſeech, and intreat them to come and accept of mercy and favour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Firſt we may ſee here, that the way of the Lord Chriſt is for ſinners to come in to him, and to the Father freely; <hi>Whoſoever is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſt let him come;</hi> he doth not ſay, let him be <hi>compelled</hi> to come forc't to come, but <hi>let him</hi> come, he holds out ſuch riches of Grace and mercy, ſuch treaſures and excellencies, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if a ſoule do but conſider and well weigh
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:108127:93"/>them, it will come: Chriſt himſelfe came free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to us, and he would have us come freely to him. There is no forcing in the Act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertion, but all is free, though God puts forth a mighty power in the hearts of people, yet he overcomes them with ſweetneſſe and loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: <hi>Let him that is athirſt come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, they are bidden in the 14 of <hi>Luke to compell them to come in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is not an outward compulſion, he doth not ſpeake of force of Armes, but goe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them to come in with force of Argument; propound unto them ſuch motives in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as may compell them to come in, tell them of the Beauty of holineſſe, tell them of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Grace, tell them of the Love of God and Chriſt, tell them of the pardon of ſins, and anſwer their objections:—There's no forcing in the work of Grace; no forcing men to come unto God and Chriſt, but it's all a free worke: God draws, but he drawes with coards of love, he carries not men againſt their wills to Chriſt, and forces them to beleive in Chriſt, no, but he ſweetens their wills, and overcomes them with kindneſſe, and Truth, the Majeſtie, Glory and lovelineſs of truth overcomes their wills, ſo that men come willingly to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly Chriſt being deſirous that ſinners ſhould come unto him, then let us not goe to any other: many ſeeke out to others, and ſay with them in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Pſal: Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> there is no releife for poore ſinners in any other but in Chriſt, tis not running to <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor to <hi>David,</hi> nor to Prophets, nor to any but to Chriſt, 'tis not friends, 'tis not honours, 'tis
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:108127:94"/>not Riches, 'tis not gifts and Talents 'tis not any thing in the creature can releive a thirſty ſoule, but Chriſt: <hi>If any man thirſt let him come,</hi> come, whither, come to Chriſt, all other things doe proclaime unto you, 'tis not in them, ſaith the wedge of Gold, 'tis not in me, ſaith houſe and land, 'tis not in us, ſay the ſhips on the Sea 'tis not in us, and ſo ſay all other creatures, 'tis onely in Jeſus Chriſt to releive a poore ſoule: <hi>Math:</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and heavie laden, and I will give you reſt:</hi> he doth not ſay that mountaines can refreſh you, that Angells can refreſh you, or any creature can refreſh you, but come unto me all ye that are weary and heavie laden, <hi>and I will give you reſt.</hi> All the virtue that refreſhes a guilty ſoule, a thirſty ſoule, a ſinfull ſoule, all the virtue is in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is water of life, he is a fountaine of living water, he hath to give you that which will doe your ſoules good, hee can give you his blood to quench the fire of hell, to purge away your guilt, to remove wrath to come, 'tis in Chriſt and in none other: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all thoſe that goe to others, forſake their owne mercies, and imbrace lying vanities, but thoſe that come to Chriſt, they goe the right way.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; Doth Chriſt invite us to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, then let us examine and make inquiry, whether wee are come to Chriſt or no: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive here's hardly any under this roofe, but thinkes he is come to Chriſt that he is a true Chriſtian; and its worth the Inquiry then, that he may reſolve this caſe, ſo that he may not be deceived; for Chriſt ſaith in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Math:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:108127:94"/>In that day many ſhall ſay, Lord, Lord have not we done thus and thus in thy preſence;</hi> but Chriſt ſhall ſay unto them, <hi>depart from me, I never knew you,</hi> you never came to me: I ſay then, it may be worth our time to make Inquiry after this caſe of Conſcience, whether wee are come to Chriſt yea or no; and I ſhall in a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars cleere it up unto you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The ſoule that is in truth come to Chriſt, hath ſeene a ſufficiency in Chriſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive it every way, and ſuch a ſufficiency, as hath made it to venture it ſelfe upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt alone, and nothing elſe: — Now apply this to your owne ſoules: have you ever ſeene ſuch ſufficiency in the Lord Jeſus, as heaven and earth beſides hath not? — And ſo ſeene as to make you come off from all, and venture upon him alone; if you have cleerely ſeene the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Chriſt, then your owne righteouſneſſe is nothing to you, your owne civility, morality, and honeſty, are as nothing, though they are good in regard of men, yet they are nothing in regard of God, and in regard of your ſoules:— You ſee an allſufficiency in Jeſus Chriſt, and an utter inſufficiency in your ſelves; Alas, what's my righteouſneſſe ſaith the ſoule that's come to Chriſt, my righteouſneſſe is filthineſſe, and all that ever I can doe is unprofitableneſſe before God; and though I have learning and wiſdome and parts, and memory, and utterance and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and honours, and follow a calling, and doe good in my place, (and the like) alas all theſe are nothing, I account them but as dung ſaith the ſoule in reſpect of Chriſt, there's an alluſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in Chriſt; I but theſe may damne me and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:108127:95"/>ſend me to hell: now put theſe to your owne hearts, for it's ill to be deceived in matters of eternity; have you ſeene (I ſay) ſuch a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in the Lord Jeſus, of wiſdome and ſtrength, and righteouſneſſe, (and the like) as you have laid downe all your owne, and ſee it nothing, and have ventured your ſoules nakedly upon Jeſus Chriſt. In the 45 of <hi>Iſa:</hi> 24. <hi>Verily ſhall one ſay, In the Lord have I righteouſneſſe and ſtrength,</hi> I have none in my ſelfe. It is a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the laſt times concerning Chriſt:— <hi>I have ſworne by my ſelfe, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſſe, and it ſhall not returne; that unto me every knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſhall ſware:</hi> It's ſpoken of Chriſt, and applyed to him in the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Surely ſhall one ſay, In the Lord have I righteouſneſſe and ſtrength, <hi>even to him ſhall men come;</hi> marke, <hi>in the Lord ſhall all the ſeede of Iſrael be Juſtified and ſhall Glory;</hi> unto him ſhall they come, <hi>And all that are incenſed againſt him ſhall be aſhamed:</hi> what go to Chriſt ſaith one, there's nothing in Chriſt, and men ſpeake blaſphemouſly and baſely of Chriſt in theſe dayes, but they ſhall be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: <hi>But unto HIM ſhall men come, and in the Lord ſhall all the ſeede of Iſrael be Juſtifyed and ſhall Glory;</hi> they ſhall be juſtifyed in Chriſt, therefore deale really with your owne hearts therein, there is a fundamentall truth to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from your owne righteouſneſſe, and to build wholly upon Chriſt; thoſe that come to him doe ſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſoule that is come unto Chriſt, it doth ſtay it ſelfe upon him, and reſts upon him, and goes not out from him; as it ventures
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:108127:95"/>it ſelfe upon Chriſt, ſo it reſts it ſelfe content with Chriſt. You know a Woman when ſhee hath choſen a Man for her husband, ſhe reſts content in him above all the men in the world; and the ſoule that hath choſen Chriſt, and come to Chriſt, and beleives in Chriſt in truth, reſts content with the Lord Jeſus above all in heaven and earth. In the 6th of <hi>John</hi> Chriſt puts a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to <hi>Peter; Jeſus ſaid unto the twelve, will ye alſo goe away? Then Simon Peter anſwered him, Lord, to whom ſhall we goe, Thou haſt the words of eternall life;</hi> Lord, to whom ſhould we goe, we are ſatisfied with thee, we reſt content with thee, we looke not beyond thee, we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in thee and from thee to bring us to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life: — ſo that a ſoule that's truly come to Chriſt will joyne nothing with Chriſt, but reſts ſatisfied with him alone; try your ſelves thereby.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A ſoule that is come to Chriſt in truth, doth accept of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne termes; many they will accept of Chriſt but it ſhall be upon their termes, ſo I may have Chriſt and the world ſaith one, I will be content to be a Chriſtian, ſo I may have Chriſt and honours ſaith another, ſo I may have Chriſt and my luſts ſatisfied, and injoy them, I will come to him, ſaith a third; ſo I may live and take my eaſe and goe to heaven at laſt I will have Chriſt, ſaith a fourth man. Thus men will have Chriſt upon their termes, but a ſoule that is thirſty and comes to Chriſt in truth, takes the Lord Chriſt upon his owne termes; <hi>If any man,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>will be my Diſciple he muſt deny himſelfe, and take up his Croſſe:</hi> Theſe are
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:108127:96"/>Chriſts termes, a man muſt lay aſide his owne wiſdome, a man muſt be content to bare a Croſſe, to meete with reproach, priſons, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, perſecutions, hard meaſure, Chriſt and a Croſſe, Chriſt and a priſon, Chriſt and hunger, and nakedneſs, and perill, and temptations, or whatſoever God will; <hi>For we are ſlaine all the day long for thy ſake,</hi> in the <hi>Pſa:</hi> and in the 8 <hi>Rom:</hi> ſo that a ſoule that doth come to Chriſt in truth, takes Chriſt upon his owne termes, Chriſt and mortification of your luſts, Chriſt and death to the world, Chriſt and death to ſin, theſe goe together; but men would have Chriſt and live to the world, and live to ſin, and live unto vanity, but theſe cannot ſtand together: he that is Chriſts, he hath crucifyed the fleſh with the affections and luſts thereof, he hath crucifyed them, and accepts of Chriſt upon his owne termes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Where the ſoule doth truly come to Chriſt and cloſe with him, there it gives up it ſelfe to Chriſt to be diſpoſed of: As a woman when ſhe is married, ſhe leaves her fathers houſe, her mothers houſe, and ſhe gives up her ſelfe to be guided by the Guide of her youth, by her husband. Therefore in the 45 <hi>Pſalme</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Hearken ô daughter and conſider, and incline thine eare, Forget alſo thine owne people and thy Fathers houſe, ſo ſhall the King greatly deſire thy beauty; For he is Thy Lord, and worſhip thou him: Forget thine owne people, and thy Fathers houſe:</hi> ſo a ſoule gives up it ſelfe to Chriſt, and forgets all former Ingagements, former cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, practiſes, and wayes it walkt in, and gives up it ſelfe to be ruled now by Chriſt, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108127:96"/>by his Lawes; ſaith the ſoule I am come into a Kings Family, I am come into a great Court, I muſt now be ruled by the Lawes of this King, by the Lawes of his houſe; and therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>My ſheepe heare my voyce:</hi> If I am one in the Fould of Chriſt, and a ſheepe of Chriſt, I will heare his voyce, and a ſtranger I will not heare, a ſtranger I will not follow.</p>
            <p>Now how is it with you, doe you follow the voyce of the world, of the fleſh, of hell, you have not given up your ſelves to Chriſt, if you had, you would follow him, and heare him, and not ſtrangers. In the 14. <hi>Revel: The</hi> 144. <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand follow the Lamb whither ſoever he goes;</hi> they doe not follow the Lyons of the world, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lamb whither ſoever he goes: Chriſt is their head, Chriſt is their Lord, Chriſt is their Guide; ſo the ſoule that's come to Chriſt is guided and led by Chriſt, and followes Chriſt; try your ſelves there.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, A ſoule that is come to Chriſt in truth, is daily made more and more like unto Jeſus Chriſt, the more it is conformed to Chriſt daily; when once it comes to Chriſt, the ſoule ſees ſuch beauty, ſuch glory, ſuch excellency in Chriſt, ſuch wiſdome in Chriſt, that it's willing to be conformed to Chriſt in every thing, not my will but thy will Lord Jeſus, not my thoughts but thy thoughts; ſaith the Apoſtle, we have the very minde of Chriſt, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the minde of Chriſt, but the life of Chriſt; for in the 2 <hi>Gal:</hi> 20. <hi>I live not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but Chriſt lives in me;</hi> ô I am conformed to Chriſt, I live the very life of Chriſt; ſo that a true Chriſtian, a true beleiver, is conformed by the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:108127:97"/>renewing of his minde into the Image of Chriſt, into the life of Chriſt, into the minde of Chriſt, into the Graces of Chriſt, he is more and more changed into Chriſt, ſo that in a ſence he may be called Chriſt, as the Church is 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 12.12. The Church is called Chriſt, becauſe the Church is transformed into the Image of Chriſt; ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very true beleeving ſoule is tranſformed more and more into Chriſt daily. 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3. laſt, <hi>But we all with open face beholding as in a Glaſſe the Glory of the Lord,</hi> that is, of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>are changed into the ſame Image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Now then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, reflect upon your ſelves, and deale im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially with your own ſoules, and if you finde theſe things, there's abundance of comfort will be to you, and you will have abundance of peace when you come to dye. And if it be not ſo with you, labour to have it ſo, and doe not ſuffer Satan, nor the fleſh, nor any thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude and deceive you in a buſineſs of ſo great concernment; ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If any thirſt, let him come,</hi> come to me; and ſo much for that uſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The laſt uſe is a uſe of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Seeing the Lord Chriſt invites us to come, let us come unto him: why Lord, doeſt thou ſay come, here I am, here I am, I come Lord, I come, with my whole heart I deſire it, I am ſorry I have ſtaid ſo long from thee: I come ô Lord, I come I come: — how would this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the Lord to ſee ſuch a frame of ſpirit in a Congregation, that ſinners would come unto him. You have heard how deſirous Chriſt is of it, and why he is ſo deſirous, ô well, let us come
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:108127:97"/>to the Lord Jeſus, and to propound ſome things to promote this exhortation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Firſt of all Conſider our owne condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what we are out of Chriſt, what are we without Chriſt, are we not all like men of blood? You read in the Law of Cities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and when a man-ſlayer was purſued by the Avenger, unleſs he got to the Citie of Refuge, he was a dead man: why all the men in the world are in that caſe, all murderers; we by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in <hi>Adam</hi> fell from God, and have murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our owne ſoules, and we are purſued by the Devill, &amp; there is no Citie of Refuge but Chriſt, that's the meaning of it; The Cities of Refuge were types of Chriſt; and as they flying to the Cities of Refuge were preſerved alive, ſo poore ſinners flying to Chriſt, ſhall be preſerved from Satan that ſeekes to murder us to all eternitie. Therefore conſider what you are without Chriſt, and out of Chriſt: — we are men ſick and ſick unto death, and there's no Phycitian can cure us but Chriſt; we are men that have a Leproſie, and it cleaves ſo to us that it will be our death, unleſs we have the blood of Chriſt to clenſe this Leproſie: — we are blinde, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les we have a Guide we ſhall fall into the ditch, into the ditch of hell, out of which there is no Recovery; Therefore come to Chriſt, he is a Guide, he will Guide you in the way everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he will lead us ſo as we ſhall never fall into the ditch, ô come unto Chriſt; we are all under the Law, we are accurſed creatures, curſed ſaith the Law is every man and woman that fullfills not all things in the Law to doe the ſame: Curſed be every one that thinks but a vaine
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:108127:98"/>thought, that ſpeaks but an idle word; curſed is every man that hath done amiſſe, that hath deceived his neighbour, &amp;c. Now who muſt take off the curſe, none but Chriſt, who was made a curſe by hanging upon the tree; ô there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come to Chriſt, chooſe Chriſt, cloſe with Chriſt, venture your ſoules upon Jeſus Chriſt, truſt in him, and him alone, reſigne up your ſelves wholly to him.</p>
            <p>Conſider what you ſhall have by coming to Chriſt? — have, — who is able to tell you what you ſhall have by Chriſt? If a man had the tongue of men and Angells he could not ſet it out, what poore ſinners ſhall have by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>You ſhall have pardon of all your ſins; — you ſhall have peace of Conſcience that paſſes underſtanding; — you ſhall have found Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and know God and Chriſt, which is life eternall; — you ſhall have Chriſts wiſdome, Chriſts righteouſneſſe, Chriſts ſanctification, Chriſt to be your Redemption; — you ſhall have the hidden <hi>Manna;</hi> — you ſhall have the white Stone; — you ſhall have the new name; — you ſhall be made a pillar in the Temple of God;—you ſhall be made a member of Chriſt; —you ſhall be made a Temple of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;—you ſhall have the Inhabitation of the Father, and the Son, and Spirit, everlaſtingly in your ſoules; — would you have any thing that heaven hath, that God hath, that Chriſt hath, come to Chriſt and you ſhall have it.</p>
            <p>Againe, Conſider who it is that Invites you to Chriſt 'tis not <hi>Moſes,</hi> 'tis not <hi>Abraham,</hi> 'tis not <hi>Ahaſueruſh,</hi> 'tis not <hi>Heſter,</hi> but a greater then any of theſe, a greater then all theſe; —
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:108127:98"/>when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he prevailed with him to let the people goe to Mount <hi>Sinai, Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> prevailed with Angells to come in and eate and drinke with them; <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueruſh</hi> prevailed with the Nobles of 127 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces to come and feaſt with him; <hi>Heſter</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with <hi>Ahaſueruſh</hi> to ſhew mercy to <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> and the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and to deſtroy <hi>Haman:</hi> ſhall theſe prevaile, and ſhall not the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who is greater then all theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile? Why Chriſt was greater then <hi>Moſes, Moſes</hi> was a ſervant, but Chriſt was a Son in the houſe; <hi>Abraham</hi> rejoyced to ſee the day of Chriſt, and he ſaw it; <hi>Ahaſueruſh</hi> he was but an Earthly Prince, but Chriſt is the Prince of life, the Prince of all the Kings of the earth, an eternall Prince; <hi>Heſter</hi> a poore captive, and Chriſt is the Maſter of the marriage-feaſt: And ſhall the Lord Chriſt now intreate, Invite, and beſeech you to come in, to come to him, and will ye not hearken? <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hearkens to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> will not you hearken to Chriſt? Angells hearken to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> will not you hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Chriſt? Nobles hearken to <hi>Ahaſhueruſh,</hi> will not you hearken to Chriſt? <hi>Ahaſueruſh</hi> hearkens to <hi>Heſter,</hi> and will not you hearken to Chriſt? <hi>Let him that is athirſt come,</hi> come ſaith Chriſt, 'tis I that ſpeake to you, who am the Son of God, who am the Saviour of the world, who am the Everlaſting Father, who am the Lord of Glory, who have Heaven at my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, come, come, ô come in then to the Lord Jeſus; let not your ſins, let not Devills, let not world, let not your luſts keepe you backe from the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <pb n="182" facs="tcp:108127:99"/>
            <p> And what is it Chriſt calls you for, why doth he Invite you, is it for your hurt, is it to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid you for your ſin, is it to check you for your infirmities, is it to revile you, and reproach you for any miſcariages? If it were ſo, then you might demurre, then you might argue the caſe, then you might give a deniall, but 'tis for none of all theſe it is for your good, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Your good, God and Chriſt have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes upon men, as here men have deſignes one upon another: If they invite you to a feaſt, they have many times a deſigne upon you, but God and Chriſt have no deſignes upon you, 'tis pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, meerly, totally for your good. The Lord In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites you that you may pertake of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that you may have his wiſdome, his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, his fullneſſe, his Grace, his Glory, that you may be happie as he is happie; Chriſt gets no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by it, you have all the gaine, and all the benefit.</p>
            <p>Againe, Conſider that Chriſts tendering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto you, it is the greateſt mercy that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath to tender unto poore ſinners; what hath God in heaven now to doe your poore ſoules good withall beſides Chriſt? The Spirit comes not unleſs Chriſt ſend: The Father hath promiſed him the ſending of the Spirit: But God he houlds out Chriſt to you; <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his onely begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. 'tis the greateſt mercy, I ſay, that heaven hath to tender unto you: — And this day in the name of the great God, I do tender Jeſus Chriſt unto you all, come in and receive Chriſt, come in and receive Chriſt, receive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be your husband, to be your King,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:108127:99"/>to be your Prophet, to be your high Prieſt, to be your Saviour, to be all in all unto you: — and know, that if you doe refuſe and will not receive Chriſt now offered to you, if you will not let goe your luſts, your drunkenneſs, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, envie, malice, ſlandering, and the like, if you will not let goe theſe for Chriſt, your damnation will be upon your owne heads, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is brought to your doores, Chriſt is laid before you, he is held out unto you; The Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Scepter this day is held out unto you, ô re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: — And if you doe not, know you provoke God more in refuſing of Chriſt, then by all the ſins that you ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: This will be the ſin that will be your damnation, <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>This is the Condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſſe rather then light,</hi> &amp;c. They love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they love ſin, ſinfull wayes, ſinfull luſts, ſinfull company, and ſinfull practiſes: Theſe you love, this is <hi>The Condemnation,</hi> when men will not receive Chriſt, they make God a lyar, and what an injurie is this to God, that you will put the lie upon God, as if God did not love the world, as if God not hold out Chriſt to ſave ſinners: And if you receive him not, you doe not bare witneſs to the truth of God, and ſett to your ſeales that God is true, and ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him: Therefore be perſwaded to come in and honour the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.— What will make it ſo hard with thoſe of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the laſt day, but becauſe Chriſt was their Prophet, and there offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and they would none of him; <hi>We will not have this man to rule over us; This is the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:108127:100"/>Heire, come let us kill him;</hi> ô therefore, it ſhall be eaſier for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> at the day of Judgement, eaſier it ſhall be for <hi>Conſtantinoble</hi> at the day of Judgement then for <hi>Stepney,</hi> that will not leave your ſinfull courſes and fall in with Chriſt, and live as Chriſt, and looke for Glory hereafter: — Why you ſhall not be alwayes here, and then comes an eternall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and why will you looſe Eternitie for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary pleaſures, and momentary riches? why will you looſe Glory, and looſe all, and have that which will a thouſand times more aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate your miſery; for had you not liv'd where the Goſpel is preached when you come to die it would not have been ſo bad, but when as you might have had Chriſt, and might have had ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and heaven, and you have neglected this, it will trouble you, and lie ſad upon you to all Eternitie: and this will ſinke you deeper into hell, That mercy is your torment, that mercy is your hell, that mercy is your damnation, and ſo it will prove to all Eternitie to all who live under the meanes, and come not in to Chriſt.

               <head>Let him take the water of Life.</head>
               <p>What's this water of life? There be variety of Interpretations of theſe words;—Some make this water of life, to be Chriſt the Fountaine of living water, the Fountaine of Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; — Some make this water to be the Spirit, who is called <hi>water</hi> frequently in the Scripture; —Some make this water to be the Doctrine of the Goſpel; — Some make this water to be Grace; — And I thinke none of all theſe are out, but all theſe may be taken in: — Chriſt is water of life;—The Spirit is water of life;—The Doctrine of the Goſpel, or the Goſpel it ſelfe is water of life; — The gifts and Graces of the Spirit are water of life. —</p>
               <p>And why are they likened unto water; I might ſpend here much time in ſhewing you the reſemblances; I will onely name them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Water clenſes from filth and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo doth the word of Chriſt; ſo doth the Goſpel; ſo doth Grace; ſo doth the Spirit; ſo doth Chriſt; <hi>You are cleane through the word that I have ſpoken,</hi> ſaith Chriſt in the 15th of <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Water ſoftens and mollifies the hard earth, ſo the Doctrine of the Goſpel, that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:108127:102"/>heavenly dew, The Graces of the Spirit, The Spirit it ſelfe, Chriſt himſelfe, doth ſoften the heart where he comes; <hi>Paul</hi> was a ſoure peice, a ſtubborne hearted ſinner, but when he met with Chriſt, and ſome of this water fell upon his heart, ſaith he, <hi>What wilt thou have me to doe Lord?</hi> he was ſoft, mollified, and melted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Water it is of a cooling nature; it cooles the heate of the Aire, and the heate of the Earth; So this water of life, it cooles the heate of Temptations, the heate of perſecution, the heate of your luſts, the heate of anger and paſſion; where any of this water comes, it cooles your unnaturall heate, and thoſe ſinfull heates that we have contracted.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Water doth make the earth to be fruitfull, the earth doth fructifie by the waters, dewes, and raines; ſo where any of this water comes, it makes men and women fruitfull; when Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Zacheus, This day is ſalvation come to thy houſe,</hi> how fruitfull was he preſently; <hi>The halfe of my goods I give to the poore;</hi> wonderfull fruitfull doth the water of the Goſpel and the Spirit make men and women.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This water doth ſatisfie thirſt, this water of life is the onely water that ſatisfies thirſty ſoules; when you have a promiſe given in, and Chriſt comes, and the Spirit comes, and divine truths are let in to your hearts, how are you ſatisfied and refreſhed?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Water doth cure and heale diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and diſtempers of body; you goe to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to the Wells, to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters you uſe, which are healing waters: The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Goſpel are healing waters: <hi>He ſent
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:108127:103"/>out his word and healed them:</hi> Chriſt ſaid to the Leper, <hi>I will, be thou cleane, and he was cleane:</hi> The word of God will heale all diſeaſes of your ſoules: 'tis not onely a patterne of wholſome words, but a patterne of healing words.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, and laſtly, Some waters are very Comfortable and Cordiall: ſo are theſe waters of life; They are very Cordiall waters, is not this text very Cordiall to thinke upon; <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely?</hi> It's a very Cordiall the water of this text. — And ſo much for the Reſemblance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween water and it.</p>

               <p>Take the Spirit for water of life; The Spirit begets life in the ſoule; it is a Spirit of life; and it's called <hi>living water:</hi> In the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Joh:</hi> 38; 39. <hi>He that beleiveth on me (as the Scripture hath ſaid) out of his belly ſhall ſlow rivers of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving water;</hi> and this he ſpake of the Spirit; the Spirit is water of life unto men and women.</p>
               <p>Take it for the Goſpel; <hi>Phil:</hi> 2.14. 'tis <hi>the word of life:</hi> the very word begets life in men and women; 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1.23. <hi>Being borne, not of Corruptible ſeede, but of Incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth for ever:</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:108127:103"/>The word of God liveth, and begets life in men and women; It's <hi>ſeede,</hi> and all true ſeede hath life in it; ſow any Corne, it hath life in it; this is divine and heavenly Corne, and when it is ſowne in your hearts it begets life there.</p>
               <p>And Grace is life, Faith is life; all Grace is life; It is the life of the ſoule; ſo that they are called <hi>waters of life,</hi> becauſe theſe waters beget life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are waters of life, becauſe they doe maintaine life begotten; We are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed of the ſame things of which we conſiſt, ſaith Philoſophie; And ſo ſaith Divinity; wee conſiſt of divine principles, a godly man is made up of the word of God, of the Divine nature, and of the Graces of the Spirit, and wee are maintained by the ſame, we are maintained by Chriſt, and by the Spirit, and by the word, and by this water of life, we live upon the ſame; Therefore Chriſt, Grace, and Spirit, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the Scripture unto things upon which men live: <hi>Iſa:</hi> 55. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, &amp;c.</hi> Water, and wine, and milke, and marrow, and bread, by ſuch things as theſe men live: <hi>Incline your ear and come unto me, heare and your ſoules ſhall live,</hi> your life ſhall be maintained by theſe things: Chriſt is the bread of life, and the water of life, and we muſt live by this bread and water live by the fleſh of Chriſt, and live by the blood of Chriſt, live by the promiſes of Chriſt, and live by the Graces of Chriſt, and ſo by the Spirit, theſe maintaine life in men and women.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It's water of life, becauſe it makes us more and more lively; it doth not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:108127:104"/>life, and maintaine life, but Increaſe life, and makes us lively: It's ſaid in the 4<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> that this water ſhall be a Well of water ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up into everlaſting life: It increaſes life, and ſprings up into more and more life: This water doth make us lively. <hi>John</hi> 10.10. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I came that ye might have life, and have it in more abundance:</hi> how lively was <hi>Peter</hi> after the water of the Spirit came upon him, in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and <hi>Peter</hi> it is that writes of living and lively ſtones; Chriſtians ſhould not onely be living but lively: this water makes lively, full of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, 'Tis water of life, becauſe it brings unto everlaſting life: he that hath the Goſpel comes to be pertaker of the Spirit, and he that hath the Spirit is pertaker of Chriſt, and he that is pertaker of Chriſt comes to God: See how this water of life ſprings up into everlaſting life; ſaith Chriſt in the 14 of <hi>Joh:</hi> 6. <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man comes unto the Father but by me;</hi> ſo that by Chriſt we come to the Father. —</p>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:108127:104"/>then you ſee what this water of life is, and why it's ſaid to be water of life: and how water?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="commentary">
               <head>Let him take the water of life <hi>freely.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>There's ſomething in this word; <hi>Take of the water of life freely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That notes firſt, let a ſinner be what he will, there is no barre put in againſt him to keepe him off from this water: let a man be a great ſinner, an old ſinner, let his ſinnes be Crimſen and Scarlet ſins, God puts in no barre: Chriſt ſaith not here, let a <hi>little</hi> ſinner, or a <hi>young</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or a ſinner that hath ſin'd once, or twice, or an hundred times, or a thouſand times, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come; but he ſaith, <hi>whoſoever will,</hi> let him take of the water of life freely: let his ſins be what they will; <hi>All manner of Blaſphemies,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſhall be forgiven:</hi> There's no barre but onely againſt the Impardonable ſin; But what ſin ſoever, though long continued in, though of the moſt hainous nature, cloathed with the moſt dreadfulleſt aggravations, yet it ſhall be forgiven, let that ſinner come, and take of this water of life freely. A Leper, a man leperous all over, may as freely goe into the river or ſea and waſh himſelfe, as the man that is ſound: There is no barre in his way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It imports thus much, let him come and pertake freely; that whatſoever qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification men have, let them be honeſt, morall, civill, ſober, righteous, juſt, (and the like) have good natures, and diſpoſitions, yet no man doth deſerve or merit any thing, not one drop of this water. Many thinke (and it's the Popiſh Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine) that men may be made meete for this
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:108127:105"/>water, and that men doe deſerve this water, and are worthy of it; No, let men be never ſo righteous, juſt morall, never ſo civill, yet when they have done all that ever they can, they doe not deſerve one drop of this water; But whoſoever will let him come and <hi>take it freely;</hi> there's no merit of thine, there's no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of thine, there's no meetneſſe in thee, but it's water that is freely prepared, and freely given.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It imports thus much likewiſe, That men may come and take abundantly of this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; As when you Invite perſons into your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, Gardens, into your Wine-ſellers, you ſay, come, eate and drinke what you will, that notes your freedome, and that they may take abundantly; ſo here, whoſoever will, let him come and take freely, let him eate, let him drinke, let him ſatisfie himſelfe, there is no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſet you ſhall have ſo much and no more, you ſhall have a pint, a quart, a pottle, or a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell full, and the like: No, here's no limitts are ſet, but take as much as you will, as much as you can carry away, <hi>Joh:</hi> 10.10. <hi>James</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, It imports this, That what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ſoever men uſe, let men ſtrive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour never ſo much, yet it is not for their indeavours that they have this water. Men muſt ſtrive, muſt read, heare and pray; They muſt digg for wiſdome as for Silver and Gold; but when they have done all, it's God that gives in this water: God gives it, but in the uſe of meanes, <hi>in</hi> their digging, <hi>in</hi> their labouring, <hi>in</hi> their waiting, not <hi>for</hi> their digging, <hi>for</hi> their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, <hi>for</hi> their waiting. <hi>Rom:</hi> 9.16. <hi>It's not
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:108127:105"/>in him that willeth, or in him that runneth, but in God that ſhews mercy:</hi> It is water freely given. Thus you ſee the words opened: — Now I come to the poynt I ſhall inſiſt upon.</p>
               <p>Doct: <hi>That the offer, or the tender of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, is free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſoever will let him take the water of life freely:</hi> It is freely offered unto men: Take Chriſt for the water of life, and Chriſt is freely offered unto the world: <hi>Jo:</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh:</hi> What's freer then gift: God hath given him, therefore Chriſt ſaith in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Joh:</hi> 10. to the woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, Dideſt thou know the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith unto thee, give Me to drinke, thou wouldeſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee water of life.</hi> Chriſt is the gift of God, he is freely given, freely tendered unto the ſons of men. <hi>Rom:</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his owne Son, but delivered him up for us all:</hi> God did not ſpare him, but freely delivered him up for us all, ſo that this water of life is freely tendered and given unto you.</p>
               <p>The Spirit, is not that freely tendered unto men; <hi>Ezek:</hi> 26.25. <hi>I will ſprinkle cleane wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon them, and waſh them from all their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, I will put my Spirit into them.</hi> In <hi>Joel, I will powre out my Spirit upon all fleſh:</hi> the Lord tenders this water of life freely. In the 11th of <hi>Luke,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If ye that are evill, can give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall my Father give the Spirit to them that aske him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Goſpel is freely given; ſaith Chriſt to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:108127:106"/>his Diſciples, <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give:</hi> and in the 16 of <hi>Mark: Goe preach the Goſpel to every creature.</hi> The Goſpel is the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Grace, the miniſtration of the Spirit: So that all the water of life is freely given: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel:</hi> 21.6. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, it is done, I am Alpha, and Omega, the beginning and the end, I will give unto him that is athirſt, of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the water of life freely:</hi> I will give free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As this water of life is freely given: — ſo 'tis freely revealed: God made it knowne free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>Math:</hi> 13.11. <hi>To you its given to know,</hi> &amp;c. none elſe made it knowne: God might have kept this Fountaine ſhut up in heaven, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have diſcovered the Fountaine, never have made knowne to the world any ſuch water, any ſuch Grace, any ſuch mercy as here is held out to you; hence is it that Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Peter</hi> in the 16th of <hi>Math:</hi> 16, 17. When <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou art the Son of the living God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Bleſſed art thou Symon Bar-Jona, for fleſh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. God revealed it unto him: and in the 21 of <hi>Math: I thanke thee ô Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto Babes:</hi> — God reveales this water and makes it knowne: —And as God reveales it, ſo it is the Lord that bleſſes this water, and makes it a bleſſing to one and not unto another: This water was a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto <hi>Peter,</hi> it was not a bleſſing unto <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das: Judas</hi> had no bleſſing by the Goſpel, no bleſſing by Chriſt: So thoſe of <hi>Capernaum</hi> and other places, they had no bleſſing; it's God gives the water, reveales the water, and bleſſes this water to whom he pleaſes.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:108127:106"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Queſt:</hi> Why doth the Lord freely offer and tender this water of life unto the world, unto ſinners?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> This water of life is freely tendered, firſt, that ſo God might make knowne his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and make way for his Glory. Things that come freely, doe diſcover the goodneſſe of any, and redound moſt to their praiſe, moſt to their honour: when a parent ſhall out of his owne good will give unto a childe great matters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt for, unſought for, unthought of, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues the goodneſſe of the parent, and drawes more honour: When a Prince ſhall give unto his Subjects out of his owne bounty and good will, not being mov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d by his Nobles or Princes, or others about him, this declares his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and makes way for his honour: and every one ſaith, What a good Prince is this, or what a good King is this, and how honourable is this: he doth it freely, none mooves him to it? when men are moov'd to doe good, thoſe that moove them they ſhare in the good, they ſhare in the honour, had not the party moov'd, it had nor been done: Now God will have none to ſhare in his honour: God doth it freely, according to the Counſell of his owne will, for his owne name, that ſo his goodneſſe may be knowne, and his honour may be great; <hi>Be it knowne unto you,</hi> ſaith God in the 36 of <hi>Ezek: that not for your ſakes doe I this, but for mine owne Name ſake:</hi> I doe it not becauſe you moove me, or any moove me, but from within, for mine owne will, and ſo his goodneſſe appeares, and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is the greater.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lord tenders water of life
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:108127:107"/>freely to ſinners, that ſo he may take away all objections, all ſcruples and feares which uſually lie in the hearts of ſinners, when people have ſinn'd againſt God, are guilty, and unholy, they are affraid of God; <hi>Adam</hi> runs from God and hides himſele: they have hard thoughts of God, and thinke God will not be pacifyed towards them. Now the Lord to prevent this, and take away all ſuch objections, ſcruples, and feares, out of the mindes and hearts of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, doth freely tender water of life, freely hold out the Golden Scepter, freely offer pardon, peace, Grace and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Lord doth this, that ſo he may indeare our hearts the more unto him: when a thing comes freely from others, how doth it worke, what hold doth it take of the heart, it knitts the heart much unto them. In the 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 7. the Lord there comes to <hi>David</hi> and tells him what great matters he would doe for him, and for his houſe, and <hi>v:</hi> 18. <hi>Then went King David in and ſat before the Lord and ſaid, Who am I ô Lord God, and what is my Fathers houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto, and this was yet a ſmall thing in thy ſight ô Lord God; But thou haſt alſo ſpoken of thy ſervants houſe for a great while to come, and is this the manner of men ô Lord God.</hi> What will God deale thus by man, to come to him and offer him ſuch kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſuch mercy, to deale ſo bountifully and freely with him, is this the manner of men, even this is the manner of God to deale with man, that ſo he may indeare their hearts unto him. And ſo <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whence is it that the Mother of my Lord ſhould come unto me?</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:108127:107"/>What <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to come unto mee, and give me a viſit that am a poore deſpiſed creature? When things are done freely, and unexpectedly, they doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deare and ingage the heart abundantly.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Lord doth freely hold out Grace and mercy to ſinners, to prevent pride &amp; boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were there any free-will, power, or qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in man, which might move or draw God to beſtow and give theſe waters, man would be ready to attribute the thing to himſelfe, and to glory and boaſt: now that man may not glory nor boaſt, the Lord doth freely beſtow and give the water of life. 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1.27. <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and hath choſen the weake things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; The baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſed hath he choſen, and things which are not, to bring to nought the things which are; That no fleſh ſhould Glory in his preſence.</hi> God would have none to Glory in his preſence, therefore he takes things that are moſt unlikely, fooliſh, and weake, contemptible, deſpiſed.</p>

            <div type="application">
               <head>Application.</head>
               <p>Firſt of all, Doth the Lord freely tender wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life unto us: Then this ſerves to reproove thoſe that doe refuſe to receive this water.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, are there any ſuch in the world, what will any refuſe water of life, can there be any ſuch living?</p>
               <p>Yes beloved, too many, the world is full of them, alwayes was, and now is full of ſuch: And that I may not give you words onely, take
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:108127:108"/>Scripture, looke into the 81 <hi>Pſal:</hi> 11. <hi>But my people would not hearken to my voyce, and Iſrael would none of me:</hi> Marke, <hi>My people,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>would not hearken to my voyce,</hi> I came and told them of water, and water of life, and ſet life and death before them, but my people would not hearken to my voyce, they would none of me the Fountaine of living water; Though God were the Fountaine of living waters they would none of him: <hi>Iſrael</hi> it ſelfe would none of him. And in the 65 of <hi>Iſa:</hi> 2. <hi>I have ſpread out my hands all the day unto a Rebellious people, which walketh in a way which is not good, after their owne thoughts:</hi> I have all the day ſpread out my hands to them, and held out water of life unto them, and they would none of me. So in the 1 of <hi>Pro:</hi> 24. <hi>I have called and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hands, and no man regarded, but ſet at naught all my Counſells, and would none of my Reproofe:</hi> It was very frequent in thoſe dayes, they would none of the water of life: — And was it not ſo in Chriſts time, and in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times, 23 of <hi>Math:</hi> 37. <hi>ô Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, how often would I have gathered thee, as a hen doth her chickens, and ye would not:</hi> I would have had you to receive water of life, and to have liv'd, but <hi>ye</hi> would not: <hi>He came to his owne and they received him not.</hi> In the 23 of the <hi>Acts</hi> 46. <hi>It was neceſſary that the Goſpel ſhould firſt have been preached unto you, but ſeeing ye put it from you we turne to the Gentiles.</hi> So in all Ages, the greateſt ſort of people refuſe the water of life: — they chooſe ſtrange waters, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.24. <hi>Heb:</hi> 13. They follow ſtrange Doctrines, ſtrange opinions, ſtrange Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:108127:108"/>puddle waters, poyſoned waters, but as for the waters of life they will have none of them.</p>
               <p>Now ſee the evill of this in Refuſing the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This will appeare,
<note place="margin">The evill of refuſing the waters of life.</note> if you Conſider what it is they doe refuſe; It is water of life: If it were ill, bitter, corrupt, poyſoned water, it were ſomething, but it's water of life, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets life, maintaines life, increaſes life, brings unto life everlaſting: the more excellent any thing is that is refuſed, the greater the evill: To refuſe a bag of duſt, To refuſe a bottle of ſome muſty liquor were nothing, but to refuſe a wedge of Gold, a bottle of Spirits, this ſhews folly and weakneſs: Who that hath a right minde would refuſe Gold, when it's offered, water of life when it's offered? it's the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing, and yet men refuſe it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is that which is freely offered, if it were put upon hard termes, if men were to buy it at deare rates, if they were to bring bags of money for it, there were ſome pretence for refuſing, for every one hath not bags of money, as <hi>Symon Magus</hi> had, but it's not to be ſould for money, it's freely given, and when ſuch a Commoditie of ſuch infinite worth is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered freely to you, and you will have none of it, your ſin is great; it was <hi>freely</hi> offered, and you would have none of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider who it is offers it, it is offered by Chriſt, by the Miniſters of Chriſt it is offered unto you dayly; but here in the Text it's offered by Chriſt. Now ſhall Chriſt who is the Son of God, the Prince of life, the Heire of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:108127:109"/>the world, who is worſhipped by Angells, who is the great Commander of Heaven and Earth; ſhall he come and offer you water of life, and will you have none of it? ſhall he that loves ſinners, and laid downe his life for them, and would waſh them in his blood, ſhall he come and tender the Goſpel, and Grace to you, and will you have none thereof? your ſin is great, exceeding great.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider, it is the greateſt Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that ever was in men and women, that Chriſt ſhould bring water of life, and freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it unto you, and you have extreame need of it, and yet will have none of it: he doth it out of love, and aymes at your good, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of your ſoules, and yet you will have none of this water, what Ingratitude is this? Chriſt may ſay, I brought water to your doore, and ſuch water as was water of life, it would have quickned you, maintain'd life in you, &amp; brought you to Eternall life, and you would none of it; heare ô Heavens, and hearken ô Earth, was there ever ſuch Ingratitude!</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Conſider, that this water of life is the onely remedy can doe your ſoules good: It's the mercy of God in Chriſt, its Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the Spirit and the Graces thereof muſt doe ſinners good, if any thing in heaven and earth can doe them good; There is nothing in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth beſides free Grace and mercy, this water of Life, which can doe your ſoules good: If you will not drinke of this water, you muſt die: you muſt die and periſh for ever, as in <hi>Jonah; They imbrace lying vanities, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their owne mercies;</hi> ſo all men and women
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:108127:109"/>in the world imbrace lying vanities, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake theſe waters, they will drinke the muddie waters of the world, the filthy waters of ſin, of the ditches of <hi>Rome,</hi> of the puddles of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> but of theſe waters which would ſave their ſoules, they will not drinke: this is an evill againſt the Remedy.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Conſider that the refuſall of theſe waters provokes God and Chriſt greatly to wrath, you cannot provoke God more then by refuſing his kindneſſe; you greive you vex the Spirit, you reſiſt the Spirit, and ſo provoke God bitterly: <hi>Pſal:</hi> 81.11, 12. ſaith he, <hi>My people would not hearken to my voyce, and Iſrael would none of me; ſo I gave them up to their owne hearts luſts:</hi> I will ſcourge them no more, but give them over to the ſaddeſt Judgements in the world, they ſhall be left to their owne luſts, their own wills and humours: I will leave them now to drinke waters will poyſon them, waters will ripen them for hell. So in the 14 of <hi>Luke,</hi> thoſe that were Invited to the Supper, they made excuſes all and would not come, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>not one of them ſhall taſt of my Supper:</hi> The meaning is, they ſhall not onely not taſt of the dainties I have prepared, but they ſhall taſt of the ſeveritie of my wrath: In ſtead of cups of vvine, they ſhall have cups of Brimſtone &amp; fire: The vengeance written they ſhall have executed upon them. When God offered <hi>Canaan</hi> to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and they reſuſed it, and would goe back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> God was ſo mooved, that he ſware in his wrath, If they ſhall enter into my Reſt, If they enter into my Reſt, let me be thruſt out of heaven; And the <hi>ſierceneſſe</hi> of Gods anger
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:108127:110"/>never came upon the <hi>Jewes</hi> till they had refuſed Chriſt, and theſe vvaters of life; But then the wrath of God came upon them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, to perfection it came upon them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Laſtly, Thoſe that refuſe the vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life, The Lord Chriſt, and God, doth keepe account of all ſuch paſſages, and will bring them in againſt them, and urge them as aggravations of their miſery at laſt: The Lord keepes account: <hi>I have ſtretched out my hands all the day long,</hi> ſaith God; A whole day, the day of their lives I waited upon them, <hi>Fortie yeares long was I greived with this Generation: Revel:</hi> 3.20. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Behold I ſtand at the doore and knock;</hi> Chriſt keeps account how long he ſtood there, how many knocks he hath made there; how many tenders of Grace have been preſented to you? how often you refuſed and turned them away? He will come at laſt and ſay, At ſuch a place I ſtood and knockt twenty or thirtie yeares, And in ſuch a place I tendered Grace to them a thouſand times, and my Spirit preſented good motions to them ten thouſand times, and yet they refuſed: All theſe vvill be brought in at laſt, and then vvhen you ſhall ſee this black bill, this will ſinke you into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of hell. Grace offered, peace offered, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven offered, Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be your portion, and you would none of all theſe: and what did you chooſe, chaffe, earth, puddle water, your miſery will be exceeding great?</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE come now to a uſe of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. If the waters of life be freely offered, then here's an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to all ſinners to come and accept of theſe waters: Come ye ſinners whoſoever ye be, ye that are in the chambers of Death, ye that are in the broad way, ye that are enemies to God through wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed workes in your minde, ye that have liv'd baſely to the diſhonour of God and man, to your owne prejudice and damnation; If you will come, here are waters and waters of life, waters will give life to the dead, here are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to increaſe life, here are waters to be had freely, Come to theſe waters; theſe waters are held forth upon ſuch tearmes, that ye may all come and receive them, whoſoever will let him come and take of the waters of life. In the 55 of <hi>Iſa:</hi> 7. It's ſaid, <hi>Let the wicked forſake his wayes, and the unrighteous his thoughts, and turne unto the Lord, and he ſhall have mercy:</hi> Pro: 28. It's ſaid, <hi>He that confeſſes his ſins and forſakes them ſhall finde mercy:</hi> There the termes are ſomewhat hard, who can forſake his wayes, and turne from his evill thoughts, and the like, it's
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:108127:111"/>a hard thing to doe: But here it's upon other termes; <hi>Whoſoever will let him come and take of the waters of life freely:</hi> — You may have them freely, whatſoever your ſins have been, crimſen ſins, ſcarlet ſins, crying ſins, ſins againſt light of nature, againſt Law, againſt heaven, againſt earth, ſins againſt State, againſt Church, againſt ſoule or body, ſins againſt Goſpel, whatſoever your ſins have been, here are waters of life free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for you: <hi>Abraham</hi> was an Idolater, and yet he had water of life freely: <hi>Saul</hi> was a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he had water of life freely, and why may not you have waters of life freely. A man may goe and take water at any Well in a Towne, he may goe to the Thames and take water what he will, when the Raine falls who may not have a ſhare of it? here's water, here's raine from heaven, and who will, may come and take water of life. Sometimes money is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a place for poore people, and it is made knowne for them to come and fetch it, but they muſt firſt get Petitions, Juſtices, Miniſters, and other mens hands, of their honeſty, of their faithfullneſſe, of their ſervice, of their ſufferings, of their loſſes, and a great deale of dooe there is before they can have the money; but it is not ſo here, Chriſt doth not ſay, Let him that is righteous come, let him that is ſo qualified take it, let him that hath ſuffered ſuch hard things, let him that hath been tempted ſo long by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, no, but he ſaith, who ever will, let <hi>him</hi> take the waters of life freely: what will you ſtand out then and not receive waters of life: ô come in this day, come in to Chriſt, come in and drinke waters of life, come in and live, come and live
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:108127:111"/>comfortably, come and live eternally.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Againe in the next place: If the water of life be freely offered to ſinners, then you that barren and dead hearted, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of unfruitfullneſſe and unprofitableneſſe: waite upon the Lord Chriſt in the uſe of means, for here is water and water of life, and Chriſt gives it out in the uſe of meanes: Are you dry, barren and fruitleſſe? have you a dead heart? Chriſt hath water of life to quicken you: Chriſt hath water of life to make you more lively: <hi>I am come,</hi> ſaith Chriſt in the 10th of <hi>Joh:</hi> 10. <hi>that ye might have life, and that ye might have it in more abundance:</hi> I am come for that very end to give life, and to give life more abundantly, to give out theſe waters freely and fully. You know when the Raine falls from heaven upon the mountaines and barren places, it will make them looke Greene; ſo when Chriſt gives out theſe waters to mountanous hearts, to barren ſpirits, this water of life will ſoke into you, ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you, make you grow, flouriſh, and bring forth fruit. <hi>Lam:</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>The Lord is good unto them that waite for him, to the ſoule that ſeeketh him;</hi> 'tis good that a man ſhould both hope and quietly waite for the ſalvation of the Lord: — <hi>The Lord is good to them that waite for him;</hi> If you will waite for Chriſt in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, he will be good unto you, he will wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you, and make you like a watered Garden. In the 40 of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28, 29.31. <hi>Haſt thou not knowne, haſt thou not heard, that the everlaſting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not, neither is weary, there is no ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his underſtanding, he giveth power to the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:108127:112"/>faint, and to them that have no might he increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſtrength, they that waite upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up with wings as Eagles, they ſhall run and not be weary, and they ſhall walke and not faint:</hi> — Waite up-upon the Lord Chriſt, he hath virtue for you, he hath water of life for you. And in the 64 of <hi>Iſa:</hi> 4. <hi>For ſince the beginning of the world, men have not heard, nor perceived by the eare, neither hath the eye ſeene, O God, beſides thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him: Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth and worketh Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe;</hi> Thoſe that remember thee in thy wayes, he will meete them, he will water them, and refreſh them, and they ſhall be fruitfull. You made the Lord Chriſt to waite for your teares, he waited a long time before you ſhed one teare of Repentance, and will not you waite upon him that hath water of life for you? waite upon him in the uſe of meanes, and he will give water of liſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You that have received water of life, Remember how little it coſt you, give the honour and the Glory unto God: It coſt you nothing, you had it freely. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.1. <hi>Say not unto us, not unto us, but to thy name be the praiſe and Glory:</hi> yea all the praiſe and all the Glory. Did wee Contribute ought unto this worke of Grace, and Salvation, then we might Sacrifice to our owne Netts, but we Contribute nothing: <hi>Epheſ:</hi> 2.8. <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved through Faith and that not of your ſelves;</hi> marke, <hi>it is the gift of God: not of workes leaſt any man ſhould boaſt:</hi> — The Lord knew what man would doe if he ſhould come in, and be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:108127:112"/>with God, therefore ſaith, <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God;</hi> If you have faith, if you have Grace, if you have ſalvation, water of life, it is the gift of God: <hi>Not of workes leaſt any man ſhould boaſt;</hi> therefore let no man Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in himſelfe, but give the honour and Glory to God. In the 9th of <hi>Jer:</hi> 23, 24. <hi>Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdome, neither the mighty man in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches, but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he underſtandeth and knoweth me that I am the Lord which exerciſeth loving kindneſſe:</hi> and <hi>Iſa:</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine owne ſake, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy ſins;</hi> I doe not doe it for thy ſake ſaith God, but for mine owne ſake: for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of mine owne name I blot out thy ſinnes freely, I pardon thee, I give thee water of life. So then let us give God the honour and the Glory, and ſay as 'tis in <hi>Micha</hi> 7.18, 19. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth Iniquitie, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the Remnant of his heritage: he reteineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delights in mercy;</hi> and who is a God like unto our God, that pardoneth Iniquitie, ſins and tranſgreſſions, and why, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in mercy, not becauſe he delights in thee, or delights in me, but becauſe he delights in mercy, he delights to ſhew mercy, he blotts out ſins freely for the honour of his owne name; If therefore you have pardon of ſin, peace of Conſcience, if you have any Grace, any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Spirit, if you have any drops of this water of life, give God the Glory of it, he hath
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:108127:113"/>freely given it unto you, and that in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, when others have none or puddle wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter onely.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If God doe give us water of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then this ſhould unite and Indere our hearts unto him, and make us ſerve him freely: As he freely gives to us, ſo we ſhould freely ſerve him, many they are hardly brought of to ſeeve God, the Sabboths are tedious unto them, and when will the Sabboth be gon, prayer, Reading of Scripture, hearing of Scrmons, and to diſcourſe of heavenly things, is tedious unto them, they cannot Indure them: It's an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are fleſh, and corrupt, that they have none of this water of life; If they had they would ſerve God freely, cheerefully, willingly. In the 2 <hi>Phil: It is God that worketh in you both to will and to doe of his owne good pleaſure. Doe all things without murmuring and diſputing:</hi> When God workes in men according to his good pleaſure the Will and the Deede, <hi>Then</hi> men will doe all things without murmuring and diſputing, they will come off roundly and readily to doe the worke of God: they will be then like to <hi>David</hi> who fullfilled all the Wills of God, and gave Counſell to <hi>Solon</hi> his Son, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.9. <hi>And thou Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing minde,</hi> &amp;c. God regards not any of your ſervices, that come off heavily, dully, and with murmurings, but God loves a cheerefull giver, a willing minde: he is free himſelfe, and gives water of life free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and he would have you ſerve him cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and willingly. —</p>
            <pb n="211" facs="tcp:108127:113"/>
            <p> But to proceede to another obſervation; — <hi>Whoſoever will,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let him take the waters of life freely:</hi> Whoſoever will, The willing Man: The obſervation is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That man who is willing, or hath a willingneſs to have the waters of life, ſhall have them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be the man what he will, high or low, rich or poore, learned or unlearned, young or old, bond or free, whoſoever hath a willingneſſe in them to have the waters of life ſhall have them: — To make it out from the Scripture unto you: —</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joh:</hi> 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have life:</hi> That ye might have waters of life; were there in you a willingneſſe to have the waters of life, ſaith Chriſt, ye might have them. In the 55 of <hi>Iſa:</hi> 1.2. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth come ye to the waters, and ye that have no money, come buy and eat, yea come buy wine and milke without money and without price:</hi> ſaith Chriſt, are ye willing to have waters of life? are ye willing to have wine and milke without money? there's the ſtick, you ſay you have no money, ſaith Chriſt, will you have them without money, are you willing to have them? If you be but willing, ſaith Chriſt, you ſhall have them; are you athriſt, you ſhall have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I looke not after your money, I looke not after ſuch qualifications, or diſpoſitions, and preparations; But are you willing to have it?— <hi>Wherefore doe you ſpend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth not?</hi> And becauſe men will not come to Chriſt, Chriſt comes to them: <hi>Pevel:</hi> 3.20. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I ſtand at the doore and knocke,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>If
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:108127:114"/>any man heare my voyce, and open the doore, I will come in to him, and will Sup with him and he with me:</hi> — Chriſt comes and ſtands at the doore and knocks: You know when one comes to the doore of a houſe and knocks, if there be one within, and the party will not open the doore you cannot come in: but if the party will open the doore, you come in preſently: — Chriſt comes and kcocks now, and he would faine come in; but men and women will not open the doore: — What's the opening of the doore? your hearts are the doore, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of your hearts, is your willingneſſe that Chriſt ſhould come in, but men and women keepe the doore ſhut, and ſo Chriſt enters not: they have no willingneſſe in them; there is a Will in all men by nature, but there is not a willingneſs. If a man have a hand to receive any thing, while he keepes his hand ſhut he can receive nothing: but if he will open his hand, then he is fit to receive: a man that keepeth his mouth ſhut, he can take in no water, no wine, no food: This is the caſe, ſinners ſo long as they keepe their hearts ſhut, Chriſt knocks, the Spirit knocks, the Miniſter knocks, the word knocks, God knocks, but they will not open: and ſo there is no enterance: But willingneſſe now is the opening of the heart, and makes way for Chriſts enterance. <hi>Lydia</hi> was hearing, and her heart was opened, and Chriſt came in, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life came in. And in the 1 of <hi>Iſa:</hi> 19, 20. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eate the fatt of the Land;</hi> If ye be willing ye ſhall have the bleſſing: There is a willingneſſe required in ſinners to receive Grace, to receive mercy, to receive the waters of life.</p>
            <pb n="213" facs="tcp:108127:114"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Queſt:</hi> Now wherein lies this willingneſſe that ſhould be in ſinners to receive the waters of life, to receive Grace and Mercy?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw:</hi> It lies in three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In a high prizing of this water of life; when a man comes to have apprehenſions of worth and excellency in it, thereupon he pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth what is ſo apprehended; for you muſt know, that the opperations of the will are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the apprehenſitions of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: If a mans underſtanding have appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of a great deale of good and worth in a thing, then his will prizes the good that is in the thing anſwerably. When men have weake apprehenſions of things, they have weake pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zings of them, and value them accordingly: But if men apprehend things ſtrongly, to have a great deale of worth and excellency in them, then they prize them anſwerably: Now when the waters of life are apprehended to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good, to be an Infinite mercy, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable mercy, then the will prizes them, and prizes them above all other things: — Take Chriſt he is water of Life: <hi>Coll:</hi> 1.19 <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in Chriſt ſhould all full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe dwell.</hi> There is then all fulneſſe in Chriſt. <hi>Coll:</hi> 2.3. <hi>In him are hid all the Treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge: — Coll:</hi> 3.11. <hi>Chriſt is all in all. Paul</hi> had a large apprehenſion of the excellency of Chriſt, and <hi>Paul</hi> prizes Chriſt anſwerably, and accounts all dung for Chriſt, loſſe for Chriſt. So that there's the firſt thing in this willingneſſe that the ſoule having ſeene a worth, an excellency a tranſcendency of good, prizes it anſwerably.</p>
            <pb n="214" facs="tcp:108127:115"/>
            <p> Secondly, The ſoule hereupon comes to make choice of this good for it ſelfe: The Will chooſes this good ſo apprehended and ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. As a man, he beholds a perſon beautifull, amiable, and ſutable unto him, he prizes the perſon, and makes choice of the perſon in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for himſelfe: So the will upon apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of water of life, and the Infinite good by it, doth chooſe this water of life for it ſelfe. And thus <hi>David</hi> in the 73 <hi>Pſal:</hi> 25 <hi>v: Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth that my ſoule deſires in compariſon of thee. David</hi> ſaw ſuch worth in Chriſt, as that he doth chooſe Chriſt in heaven, and in earth, and none beſides him: <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none that I deſire upon earth beſides thee.</hi> So the Spouſe in the 5 <hi>Cant:</hi> 10. <hi>My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi> there's the choice, <hi>is white and ruddy, the cheifeſt of ten thouſand:</hi> I know what a one my beloved is, I have ſuch apprehenſions of him, <hi>he is white and ruddy, the cheifeſt of ten thouſand,</hi> better then all, and therefore I chooſe him he is <hi>my Beloved.</hi> The will comes to chooſe and take in the object ſo apprehended, for it ſelfe; that is the ſecond thing, the will acting in the choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Will mooves and carries the ſoule to the Injoying of the thing prized and choſen: As when a man hath caſt his eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a virgin, and he values her, and in his heart chooſes her; Then he uſes all lawfull meanes to Injoy her, his will carries him to the uſe of meanes: ſo here; The Will mooves the ſoule now towards Chriſt, to cloſe with Chriſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Chriſt, and doth act both inwardly &amp; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:108127:115"/>Inwardly by longings, ſighings deſires, thirſtings, ô that I had water of life, ô that I had water of the well of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, ô that I had Chriſt, ô that I had the Spirit, ô that I had Grace: — And then outwardly, it carries to the uſe of all meanes, to reading, to hearing, to meditating, to prayer, conferring, and the like, to all the ordinances, and all the meanes that it may Injoy Chriſt, and meete with him whom it hath choſen, this is the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe that is required: If you be willing; If he hath had ſuch apprehenſions, and prized the water of life, whoſoever hath made choice of it, whoſoever is moov'd and carried out to Injoy it, let that ſoule take the water of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quere.</hi> Now a Quere moveable upon this is.</p>
            <p>Whither can man by his owne abilities make this choice of Chriſt, or of this water of life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw:</hi> Men by their naturall abilities may deſire the word, and be carried out after it; <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11, 12. <hi>Behold the day is come ſaith the Lord God, that I will ſend a famine in the Land, not a famine of Bread, nor a thirſt for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but of hearing the word of the Lord, and they ſhall wander from Sea to Sea, and from the North even to the Eaſt: They ſhall run too and fro to ſeeke the Word of the Lord, and ſhall not finde it:</hi> Marke; when the word ſhould be taken away, they would have a deſire, and there would be a motion after it in them, and yet theſe it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived were not regenerate &amp; Godly, but of the ordinary and common ſort of people: The worke of reaſon, and naturall apprehenſion of ſome good to be in the word, carried them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it: But I conceive, no man can by naturall

                  </gap> Likewiſe reckon ye alſo your ſelves to be dead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unto ſin, but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> Saith <hi>Paul, I was ſlaine through ſin:</hi> But as You have life through Jeſus Chriſt, ſo muſt I have life through Jeſus Chriſt; I have no life naturally and of my ſelfe: and that place, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.14. <hi>But the naturall man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned:</hi> — Some would make this verſe to ſpeak to young Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians weake Chriſtians: <hi>But</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God:</hi> a young Chriſtian having the Spirit of God, would receive the things of the Spirit of God, &amp; would have ſome ſpirituall diſcerning: But the naturall man, is a man deſtitute of the Spirit; for he ſaith, <hi>We have received, not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God:</hi> But the naturall man now which hath not the Spirit, he receives them not, he diſcernes them not: — And that this is the meaning of the word, looke but into the 19 <hi>Jude,</hi> where you have the ſame word, <hi>Senſuall,</hi> he might Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it <hi>Naturall; Senſuall not having the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Now he that hath not the Spirit, he cannot diſcerne the things of God, he cannot deſire
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:108127:116"/>them, he cannot receive them; therefore ſaith Chriſt unto <hi>Peter, Bleſſed art thou Symon Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jona, For fleſh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee:</hi> Some boaſt they come to this by the power of nature, but God hath revealed it by the power of his Spirit: and in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. <hi>For after that in the wiſdome of God, the world by wiſdome knew not God, it pleaſed God by the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe of preaching to ſave them that beleeve:</hi> All the wiſdome of the world brought them not up to the knowledge of God: So then, by mans naturall abilitie he is not able to come to this willingneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quere.</hi> To what end then are theſe waters of life freely offered, if a man have not this power to <hi>will</hi> theſe waters; are they not offered in vaine?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw:</hi> To this I anſwer firſt, 'Tis not ſo, 'tis not in vaine; for where the Goſpel comes, there is ſo much mercie, love and goodneſſe of God held out, ſuch great pretious and free promiſes preſented unto men, as that being heeded, they beget a willingneſſe in ſinners to live, there goes a generall vertue and power with the Goſpel to doe ſomething in the hearts of men and women which they could not doe before: When the Loadſtone toucheth the needle, it makes an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and leaves ſome virtue upon it. It's ſaid in the 47 of <hi>Ezek:</hi> 9. <hi>That whitherſoever the waters of the Sactuary doe come, they heale the waters;</hi> That is, If men and women who are like the dead Sea, who are corrupt, filthy, ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and loathſome in their naturall condition, The waters of the Goſpel doe ſomething there, and they doe inable men to will, and will other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:108127:117"/>then they could before: ſo that men now living under the Goſpel, if they heed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, there is ſo much Grace, mercy, and love of God held out in the Goſpel, and ſuch breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Gods Spirit goes along with it, that if men heede the ſame, ſomething is wrought in their hearts that may Inable them to <hi>will</hi> theſe weters of life, and their not doing of this, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Ground for their condemnation.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, The Lord he tenders theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life unto whoſoever will, that ſo theſe perſons might begg of God a will to receive theſe waters, who is ready to give them theſe waters: For when they ſhall ſee waters of life held out, and it is thus, whoſoever will let him take of them: The ſoule may well conclude and ſay, Surely God will give me a will to receive theſe waters, if I begg them: So that if men and women now having waters of life held out free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doe come to God and begg of God this willingneſſe, Lord give me a Will, give me a will to cloſe with Chriſt, to prize Chriſt, to move out after Chriſt, God that will give them the waters, will give them the will: <hi>Phil:</hi> 2.13. <hi>Pro:</hi> 16.1.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Laſtly: This will Juſtifie God, and this will be Condemnation to the creature, that here's the Goſpel offered to men freely, that the Goſpel if heeded will beget a power and will in men; that God if pray'd unto will give them the will, and yet they neglect all. Mens Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation will be upon their owne heads, where is God to be blam'd? This being ſo, let us give you the reaſons why the Lord holds out waters of life to thoſe that are willing to receive them:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108127:117"/>Or why is this willingneſſe requir'd at our hands?</p>
            <p>Firſt, This willingneſs is required,
<note place="margin">Why this willingneſs is required</note> becauſe otherwiſe men will not take the waters of life, let God offer them never ſo freely, or never ſo long; If men be not willing they will not take them; preſent vvhat you vvill to a man that hath not a Will to a thing and he will not take it: ſo preſent Chriſt, the Spirit of God, life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, Heaven and Glory, the great and pretious promiſes, pardon of ſin, or what you vvill, if a man have not a vvill he vvill not take it: ſo that vvillingneſs is required to the taking: If a man have not a mouth, it is in vaine to offer him meate; If men have not a <hi>will,</hi> they vvill not receive, <hi>Math:</hi> 23.37. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. Therefore God requires vvillingneſſe that men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the vvaters of life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This willingneſſe is requir'd, that ſo men may not complaine; for if men ſhould be brought to drinke waters of life by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſory Act, they vvill complaine of vvhat fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: Therefore ſaith Chriſt in the 16 <hi>Math:</hi> 24. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelfe, and take up his croſſe and follow me:</hi> If any man <hi>will</hi> come, if a man have a <hi>will</hi> ſaith Chriſt to follow me, let him, he vvill meete with hard things, and if he be not willing, he vvill complaine that I ſhould cauſe him to follow me: Men muſt deny themſelves, and take up croſſes, and indure perſecutions and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and if they did not come willingly to Gods way they would complaine of it; Now God to prevent Complaining of his wayes, he requires that men be willing.</p>
            <pb n="220" facs="tcp:108127:118"/>
            <p> Thirdly, This is, that ſo the Communion between Chriſt and the ſoule may be the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: vvhere there is vvillingneſſe on both ſides, there vvill be the ſweeteſt life: — If the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties doe not conſent on both ſides, you will ſay, it vvill be an Ill match: But if there be a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and a freeneſſe on both ſides, there the Communion will be the ſweeter: — So Chriſt ſaith, I freely give, and I would have them free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive, and ſo there will be a ſweete Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between Chriſt and the ſoule: I am my beloveds, ſaith the ſoule, and my beloved is mine: There was mutuall Conſent and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, This willingneſſe is required, that ſo the wiſdome of God in the Governing of his Church and of the world might not be Queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for ſhould God force men to his ſervice they would ſay, where's the goodneſſe of God? where's the wiſdome of God? here's Tyranny, here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s forcing of men into the ſervice of the Lord. Now God will have none to be his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but thoſe that come freely: <hi>Pſal:</hi> 110. <hi>In the day of thy power thy people ſhall be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:</hi> — And when he ſpeakes, <hi>Compell them to come in;</hi> It is not by Clubs Law, but by ſtrong Arguments, tell them what the water of life is, tell them what Supper is prepared, tell them of the excellency of the proviſion, that ſo that may compell them, no other compulſion doth God uſe, but the Grace of the Spirit, and divine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments ſett on upon the heart.</p>
            <p>But this may ſeeme contrary to <hi>Joh:</hi> 6.44. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>No man comes to me except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw him:</hi> It ſhould ſeeme then that it is not voluntary and free.</p>
            <pb n="221" facs="tcp:108127:118"/>
            <p> I anſwer, God doth not force a mans will, but God doth ſweetly and lovingly take away the unwillingneſſe of his will, the corruption of his will: <hi>Ezek:</hi> 11.19. <hi>I will give them one heart, and I will put a new Spirit within you, and I will take the ſtony heart out of their fleſh, and will give them an heart of fleſh:</hi> I will take away the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nineſſe, the hardneſſe, that corruption, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and oppoſition, I will take away all theſe out of them, and put a new heart, and a new Spirit into them. So in the 36 of <hi>Ezek:</hi> 26. <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh, and I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walke in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keepe my Judgements and doe them:</hi> He will cauſe them to walke in his ſtatutes; vvhat will hee thruſt them on againſt their wills, no, ſee vvhat the Church ſaith, <hi>Cant:</hi> 1.4. <hi>Draw me ô Lord, we will run after thee:</hi> When God comes to draw, the ſoule runs willingly and freely. So that you ſee a willingneſſe is required.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Firſt, If thoſe that are willing ſhall have the waters of life, then here it ſerves for Conviction, and doth convince us that <hi>all</hi> who thinke and ſay they have drunke of theſe waters of life, yet have not: Every one thinks that he hath Grace, and hath the Spirit, hath Chriſt &amp; God, and that he ſhall be ſav'd, but here is cleere conviction to the contrary; for, have you had this willingneſſe in you that is required? have men ſeene ſuch excellency in theſe vvaters, as to prize them above all? have you ſo prized them as to chooſe them above all things in the world? have you ſo choſen them as to purſue the getting of them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of your power? few have done ſo: In the 7 of <hi>Math:</hi> 21, 22, &amp;c. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdome of heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in heaven: Many will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name, and in thy name have caſt out Devills, and in thy name done many wonderfull works; And then I will profeſſe unto them, I never knew
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:108127:119"/>you, depart foom me ye that worke Iniquitie.</hi> Theſe men did not ſee ſo much worth in the waters of life as they did in Iniquitie; they did not prize Chriſts Grace, his Spirit, the Goſpel, and the promiſes thereof ſo much as workes of Iniquitie; they would drinke puddle water, poyſonous water, they would not let goe their Iniquitie for Chriſt, yet theſe thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, thought themſelves ſafe, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and bleſſed creatures: The five fooliſh vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in the 25 of <hi>Math:</hi> they had gotten lamps, but they had gotten no Oyle in their lamps, they had none of this water of life, they had no Grace, they had no Chriſt, they had none of the Spirit, they had none of the truths of God in their hearts, they thought that to profeſſe Chriſt, and profeſſe the Goſpel was ſufficient; they had lamps, but where was the oyle? where was the water of life? where was Grace, they had none of it? So in the 2 of <hi>Tim:</hi> 3.5. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a forme of Godlineſſe, but denying the power:</hi> They had a forme, they came to the Aſſemblies as you doe, and ſat there, heard the word, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Chriſt, ſeemed to be Chriſtians, and it may be, did ſomething in their families, but they denied the power; they never had this willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſee the excellency of the power of Godlineſſe, never did they chooſe the power of Godlineſſe, never did they purſue after the power of Godlineſſe: — And many in theſe dayes, they live in baſe and ſinfull wayes, and yet thinke that they have water of life, that they are living Chriſtians; But 'tis with them as with the Church of <hi>Sardis; They have a name to live, but they are dead indeed:</hi> What reviling
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:108127:120"/>are there of one another? what reproaching? what backbiting and ſlandering? what drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, vvhat whoredome, vvhat oppreſſion, vvhat defrauding, vvhat contention is there? brother againſt brother, ſeeking to eate up one another, and to undoe one another, by ill lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, by ſeeking to get one from another; and yet deſirous to come to the Sacrament; whereas when men live in hatred and ſtrife, they are murderers in the Scripture account: — A dreadfull thing when thoſe that are of the ſame family, fleſh and blood, walke in thoſe wayes, and pretend that they are Chriſtians, and would have the ordinances, and yet will not lay downe their malice, revenge, and humours, no not for Chriſt, not for waters of life, not for any of his ordinances:—All are not true Chriſtians that thinke ſo, all have not taſted of the waters of life that thinke ſo, all have not Grace that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they have. The five fooliſh virgins, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they got oyle as they thought, and they came and knock at the gate of heaven, but they were deceived, they had not true oyle, they would have been let in then: That's the firſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This ſerves for reproofe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of many that ſay they would gladly have waters of life, they are willing, and would faine have Chriſt, Grace, and the Spirit, but it's evident there is no ſuch thing, becauſe they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prize them, ſo as to ſee them better then their earthly ſenſuall and ſinfull injoyments, then their outward eſtates &amp; what ever is deare unto them of that nature, becauſe they never make a reall and actuall claime of them, nor uſe the meanes to attaine them: Corne, wine, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:108127:120"/>oyle, they prize, they cloſe with, and make out after, and beſtirre themſelves ſo in the purſuit of them, that they hazard their ſoules eternally for them, but as for the waters of life, they care little for them, they have ſome ſluggiſh deſires after them, but no ſtrong no laſting indeavours, <hi>Math:</hi> 19.16, 17, 18, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24.</p>
            <p>Therefore 'tis not enough for men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſay they would have waters of life: there are many wiſhers, and many woulders in the world, but few doe truly and really will, they come not up to a prizing of them, to a chooſing of them, and to an uſing of all meanes for them they give not diligence to adde Grace to Grace, to worke out their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſhake off ſecurity and ſloathfulneſſe, and put forth themſelves as a matter of life and death, as indeed it is a matter of life and death, to get theſe waters of life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the willing man ſhall have the waters of life, then here God is excuſed, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable in the deſtruction of ſinners: The Lord he holds out waters of life freely; he ſaith, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will,</hi> whoſoever is willing let him take the waters of life, let him live and be bleſſed, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is willing: now if men periſh where is the fault, who is to be blamed, God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Chriſt, he hath provided Goſpel and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, provided his Spirit, he holds out the promiſes, and ſaith <hi>whoſoever will,</hi> whoſoever is willing come, come without money, here's wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life freely for you: now if men periſh, where's the fault; <hi>Revel:</hi> 3.20. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the doore and knock, if any man will open, I will come in:</hi> — And what if you will not open
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:108127:121"/>the doore, if Chriſt doe beate downe the houſe and the doore, and deſtroy him that is in it, who is in the fault? the fault is yours, you are not willing that Chriſt ſhould come in. In the 19 of <hi>Luk:</hi> 27. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies that would not that I ſhould reigne over them, bring hither and ſlay them before me:</hi> Thoſe mine enemies that would not have me to reigne over them, I come and tell them that I will caſt out their enemies, and I will reigne ſweetly and lovingly in them, and I will doe them good, I will ſave them, give them waters of life, cordiall comforts, and they will not; vvhat then? <hi>Bring thoſe mine enemies and ſlay them before my face.</hi> In the 23 of <hi>Math: How often would I have gathered thee, even as a hen doth her chickens and ye would not:</hi> had ye been willing ye ſhould have eate the fatt and dranke the ſweete; <hi>But ye would not; now is your houſe left deſolate;</hi> Mans deſtruction is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and God is to be juſtifyed and cleer'd, he makes ſuch tenders of Grace and mercy, and that freely he comes and waites upon men and calls upon them, and yet they will not. You have a remarkeable place, 2 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved;</hi> Marke, the truth was ſent forth, the truth came, and the truth wooed them, but they would not receive the Love of the truth, But they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved, <hi>for this Cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong Deluſions that they ſhould beleive a lie;</hi> and this is made good in our dayes exceedingly, for the truth hath come, and knockt at the hearts of men and women, and it hath not been received with the love of it,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:108127:121"/>Therefore God hath ſent them ſtrong Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they ſhould beleive a lie, <hi>That they all might be damned who beleived not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe:</hi> men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will not receive the truths of God: And then God gives them over to ſtrong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions that they might be damned, would they have received the truth, they ſhould not have been damned, nor had ſtrong Deluſions; ſo that here God will be excuſable and juſtifiable in the deſtruction of ſinners at the laſt. <hi>Joh:</hi> 3.19. <hi>This is the Condemnation that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſſe rather then light, becauſe their deeds are evill;</hi> This will be their Condemnation, they will ſhut their eyes againſt the light, they will not let truth enter, and if they doe, they withhold the truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, and impriſon the truth as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> did <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, This ſerves for Exhortation: <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will, let them take of the waters of life freely:</hi> Shall all that are willing have water of life freely, let us labour for this willingneſſe, it is a matter of great concernment, it concernes your ſoules and bodies for the preſent, and to all eternity, to ſee that there be this willingneſs in you, willingneſſe to have water of life; for all are not willing, nay vvhen it comes to the tryall, hardly one of a hundred will be found really willing to have waters of life, therefore give your ſelves no reſt night nor day till you finde a reall willingneſſe to have waters of life, to have Chriſt, and the Spirit of Chriſt, to have Grace, ſalvation, peace &amp; pardon to your ſoules,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:108127:122"/>give your ſelves no reſt (I ſay) till you finde this willingneſſe in you: — And a little to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite you unto it, and then to ſhew you how you may come to this willingneſſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider that you have a willingneſſe to other things, and that willingneſſe will doe you little good without this, nay, your willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to other things it may prejudice you, and <hi>will</hi> prejudice you unleſs you have this willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: men are willing to have honours, riches, greatneſs in the world, willing to have all things about them in the beſt manner; — what will this doe you good unleſs you have a willingneſs to the vvaters of life: Riches will not deliver in the day of wrath, there will be a day of wrath, and what will your Riches, your honours, and all doe then? Theſe will doe nothing for you, but theſe may prejudice you: 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>They that will be rich;</hi> marke, they that <hi>will</hi> be rich, that have a willingneſs that way, that ſee an excellency in Riches, chooſe them and follow them, <hi>They that will be rich fall into Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full luſts, which drowne men in deſtruction and perdition:</hi> Marke, theſe prejudice you: <hi>For the love of money is the roote of all evill, which while ſome coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes:</hi> vvhen men have ſtrong vvills to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they may prejudice themſelves and undoe ſoule and body. But if they have ſuch a will to the water of life that will advantage them. So in the 5 <hi>Chap:</hi> 6 <hi>v: She that liveth in pleaſure is dead while ſhe liveth:</hi> Some their wills carry them to pleaſure, the pleaſures of the body,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:108127:122"/>carnall delights, and they are dead while they live; have they waters of life, no, their vvills have ſlaine them: <hi>They are dead while they live.</hi> So in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Ephe: 3. <hi>Among whom we all had our Converſations in time paſt in the luſts of the fleſh, fullfilling the deſires of the fleſh,</hi> or the <hi>wills</hi> of the fleſh and of the minde: vvhen we fullfill the wills of the fleſh and of the minde, wee are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, Children of wrath, enemies to God. So that to have a will that prizes other things, that chooſes, and makes out after them, this may damnifie you and undoe you.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon why you ſhould labour to get this willingneſs is, becauſe it's that which God requires, and that which he doth onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and all he doth requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e: under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes, there was, <hi>Doe this and live:</hi> But now the laſt motion that Chriſt makes when he leaves the world, and gives out the Scripture is this; If any man have a will, if there be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs in you to waters of life, that's the thing I require, and all I require, and the onely thing I require: He doth not require great matters at your hands, he doth not ſay, give me houſe and Lands, give me your ſhops and ware, give me your Ships, give me your Limbs, your blood, your lives, no, ſaith he, If any man will, let me have but willingneſs in you, this is all I require. <hi>Pro:</hi> 23. <hi>My Son give me thy heart;</hi> What<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s his meaning, Let me but ſee a heart in thee prizing, chooſing, and purſuing of the waters of life, that's all I require, my Son give me thy heart; he doth not meane that peice of fleſh which is in your body, that you call your heart; But he
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108127:123"/>would have you have ſo much underſtanding as to ſee an excellency in himſelfe, his Son, his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, his Word and Grace: and then to chooſe the ſame, and to uſe the meanes to attaine them. This is that that God requires, and all he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; ſhall the Lord onely require your hearts, nothing but your hearts, and will not you ſtudy to have a heart willing to have God, willing to have water of life?</p>
            <p>The third and laſt Reaſon is, becauſe unleſſe you are willing, you ſhall have no water of life: vvhoſoever is willing let him take water of life, 'tis for him, God will never force you to it: If you leade a Beaſt to drinke, you doe not force the Beaſt to drinke, and God will never force men; But if willingly they will prize Chriſt, if they will chooſe Chriſt above all, if they will cloſe with him, if they will uſe the meanes that he hath appointed to Injoy him, Chriſt ſhall be their water of life, the Spirit ſhall be theirs; Take, take preſently ſaith he then, take the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, 'tis for you and for none other. By this time me thinks I heare you are ready to ſay, ô that we had this willingneſſe in us, we hope we have it or if we have it not, ô that we had hearts willing now to prize Chriſt, to chuſe Chriſt, to cloſe with Chriſt, his Grace, his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, his wayes and ordinances, then we were made, how ſhall we come by it?</p>
            <p>I ſhall propound ſeverall Conſiderations unto you, whereby this willingneſſe may be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider your owne Condition; Let every man and woman, every ſon and ſervant, ſeriouſly Conſider with themſelves in what
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:108127:123"/>Condition are we: were we not all loſt in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?</hi> are we not all under the Law, and the Curſe of the Law? Are we not all enemies to God through wicked workes in our minds? have we not abundance of guilt in our hearts and Conſciences? Are we not afraid of hell, if we ſhould die that we ſhould be damned? are we not helpleſs in our ſelves, and miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Is not God juſt, holy, and righteous? doth not the greateſt part goe the broad way, and why may not I be in the broad way? ſurely I am a wretched miſerable, a loſt and undone creature; If any poore ſoule in the world have need of water of life, I am the creature; For mine owne part I ſpeake it freely here as in the preſence of God, I know none of your greater ſinners then my ſelfe, and none of you to have greater need of the waters of life then my owne ſoule; let us not deceive our ſelves, vve are all miſerable and wretched creatures, and we all have need of the water of life, need of Chriſt, need of Grace, need of the Spirit, need of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, need of all. When a man ſits downe and Conſiders, I am in debt, I owe this man 10 <abbr>
                  <hi>l:</hi>
               </abbr> another man a 100 <abbr>
                  <hi>l:</hi>
               </abbr> another man a 1000, and I am in danger of reſting every day, I have need of ſome friend to helpe me: This is our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition now, if you would but ſeriouſly Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it would make you thinke, is there Grace, mercy with God, redemption, ſalvation for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, why not for me? This would make you begin to have ſome willingneſs in you to have waters of life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider two things of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider the very end of Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:108127:124"/>the end of his coming, the end of his being here in this world: — why did Chriſt come, I will ſhew you two or three places of Scripture; <hi>Math:</hi> 18.10. <hi>For the Son of man is come to ſave that which was loſt:</hi> If any be a loſt creature, Jeſus Chriſt is come to ſave that which was loſt; I hope then he is come to ſave me a loſt creature, I am a loſt ſheepe, a loſt Son, I am a loſt Goat: ſurely if Chriſt came to ſave that which was loſt, he came to ſave Mee: — So in the 19 of <hi>Luke</hi> 10. you have it a little more full; <hi>For the Son of man is come to ſeeke and to ſave that which was loſt;</hi> he is come to ſeeke it out, he ſeekes out the Goat, ſeekes out the loſt ſheepe, he ſeekes out a loſt ſinner, as he did the man at the poole of <hi>Betheſda, Wilt thou be made whole?</hi> ô Lord I would faine be made whole, but I have none to helpe me; well, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>be thou whole;</hi> Now ſee what uſe <hi>Paul</hi> makes of it, 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chiefe:</hi> ô Lord, doeſt thou come to ſave ſinners, here's good tydings indeed, Lord it's a faithfull ſaying, and it's worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, it's worthy you old ones ſhould receive it, you young ones ſhould receive it, you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ones ſhould receive it, you that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of your owne righteouſneſſe, that you ſhould receive it, Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, what ſinners ſoever they be, great ſinners, old ſinners, that have liv'd many yeares in a height of wickedneſſe ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> was, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, injurious perſons, &amp;c. If you ſeriouſly weigh this, it will make you willing to have theſe waters of life.</p>
            <pb n="233" facs="tcp:108127:124"/>
            <p> Secondly, Conſider in Chriſt how ſweetly he doth Invite you to take theſe waters of life: If an enemy would give you water when you were thirſty, would you not take it, <hi>Give thine enemy to drinke if he thirſt;</hi> But if the deareſt friend you have in all the world ſhould ſay, ô friend, you are athirſt, come here's water, here's wine, here's milke, here's any thing you would drinke; you would take this well which is offer'd willingly: Now have you a better friend in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth then Jeſus Chriſt, who laid downe his life, and ſhed his blood for you, ſaith Chriſt, who ever will let him come, take water, even water of life, poore ſoule, I have taken thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon me, I have borne the wrath of God, I have ſatisfyed the Law, I have laid downe my life, I come awooing to thee, and doe intreat thee, doe not damne thy ſelfe, doe not throw thy ſelfe into hell, poore ſoule take hold of me, come Ile leade thee to the water of life, come Ile give thee pardon, Ile give thee peace, Ile give thee my Spirit, Ile give thee my blood; why doeſt thou drinke puddle water, and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned water? why doeſt thou not follow me, but follow the Devill the Beaſt, and thine owne luſts? Thus the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth intreat us to take water of life In the 7 of <hi>Joh:</hi> Chriſt ſtood up after a great ſeaſt and makes a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drinke;</hi> You have been drinking wine wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſuch things as doe not quench the thirſt of your ſoules; But if there be any one man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you that is athirſt for the waters of life, let him come unto me, my armes are out, the waters are ready to give forth unto him, let him come and drinke.</p>
            <pb n="234" facs="tcp:108127:125"/>
            <p> Thirdly, Conſider the promiſes, and in them Conſider three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider the freeneſſe of the promiſe, the promiſes are held out freely; <hi>Whoſoever will let him come and take of the waters of life freely:</hi> I require no money, no qualifications or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, but freely take them; onely be willing to take them, and here they are. So in the 21 <hi>Revel:</hi> 6. <hi>I will give unto him that is athirſt of the Fountaine of the water of life freely;</hi> I will give unto him that is athirſt, that is, unto him that is willing, <hi>of the Fountaine of the water of life freely.</hi> If a man ſhould freely ſay to all the poore in a Towne, come, here's an Angell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peice for every one that will come, would not the poore come, would not this beget a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them? It's freely: he doth not ſay, if you be thus cloathed if your hands and faces be cleane, if you be finely dreſt; no but let every one come: Though they have Leperous hands, ſcald heads, lame leggs, and full of ſoares, let them come: Thus it is with the Lord Jeſus, his promiſe is free, whoſoever will ſhall freely have the water of life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider the ſufficiency and full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the promiſe, if a promiſe be free, and have not enough in it to releive a man, then he would ſtick: But there is a ſufficiency and full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the promiſe; <hi>Rom:</hi> 8.32. <hi>He hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up his Son for us all, and how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things?</hi> The promiſe hath <hi>all</hi> things in it, all things needfull for ſoule and body, for heaven and earth, for this life or the life to come, there's enough in the promiſe. So in the 81 <hi>Pſal:</hi> 10. <hi>Open thy mouth wide,</hi>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:108127:125"/>ſaith God, <hi>and I will fill it;</hi> let your deſires be never ſo large, there's enough in the promiſe to ſatisfie your deſires. <hi>Math:</hi> 5. <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that hunger and thirſt, they ſhall be ſatisfyed,</hi> they ſhall have abundance of ſatisfaction. <hi>Joh:</hi> 10.10. <hi>I am come that they might have life, and have it in more abundance:</hi> would you have life, and be lively Chriſtians, there's abundance of life in Chriſt, abundance of life in the Spirit, and in the promiſe, there's enough to anſwer all your ſoules.</p>
            <p>Then thirdly, Conſider the promiſe it is Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, it is not limited to the Jew or Gentile, to one ſort of men or women, but it is Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <hi>Whoſoever will,</hi> whoſoever is willing: If it were made to rich men, poore men, learned men, noble men, wiſe men, fooles, then ſome Queſtion might be made, but it's tendered to <hi>all:</hi> If a State offer a pardon to all the Traytors, or all the Delinquents therein, would not every one come in and ſay, I am a Delinquent, but here's a pardon offered to me; ſo every ſoule that is willing may come in and ſay, Lord Jeſus Thou ſayeſt, <hi>Whoſoever will,</hi> loe I am willing, let me have water of life: ſo that the freeneſſe, the fullneſſe, and the Generall tenders of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto all, is a ſpeciall meanes to beget wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe in us to receive the water of Life.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Further, Conſider the excellency of theſe waters of life, the neceſſitie of them, the uſe of them, theſe waters of life have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter excellency in them, then any thing you can Imagin, there's nothing in all the world is fit to be compared to the leaſt drop of the water of life, all your Gold, Silver, Diamonds, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:108127:126"/>Pearles, all your parts, gifts, and things of that nature, are ſhaddowes to the water of life: Chriſt with all his merits are water of life; The Spirit with all it's Graces are water of life: The Goſpel with all its promiſes are water of life; and you have great neceſſitie of theſe; if you have them not you will periſh, you will die &amp; be damned for ever, if you drink not of theſe.</p>
            <p>And of admirable uſe, whoſoever drinkes of this water, they will be full of ſpirits and life; full of peace and Comfort; they will be fitted for Communion with God and man, for the ſervice of heaven and earth: 7 <hi>Joh:</hi> 38, 39. when Chriſt had ſaid unto them, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drinke:</hi> it preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; <hi>This ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that beleive on him ſhould receive: and</hi> ſaith he, <hi>out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water:</hi> he ſhall have living water to flow out of his belly, and be uſefull, ſo as to water others.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Laſtly, Conſider how eaſie that which the Lord requires at your hands is: the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no hard matters of you, onely he ſaith, who ever will let him take the waters of life: The Lord might have put hard Conditions, and hard tearmes upon men and women, as <hi>Saul</hi> did upon <hi>David, Give me</hi> 200 <hi>foreskins of the Philiſtines, and thou ſhalt have Micha my Daughter to wife:</hi> as <hi>Caleb</hi> did, <hi>If any man will goe and take Kiriahſephar and ſubdue it, he ſhall have my Daughter Achſah,</hi> Joſh: 15.16. He might have put you upon it as he did the young Man in <hi>Math:</hi> 19. <hi>Goe and ſell all that thou haſt, and follow me, and thou ſhalt have waters of life;</hi> but he doth not put you upon ſuch things, he
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:108127:126"/>ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever will, let him come and drinke of the waters of life;</hi> ſo that it is upon an eaſie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Therefore Conſider theſe things, and through the bleſſing and Grace of God, they may prevaile with your hearts to be more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling then ever to have the water of life.</p>
            <p>The next uſe is to let us ſee the Infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, and Condecenſion to poore crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, That he who is greatneſſe, and Glory, Majeſtie and excellency, ſhould condeſcend to us who are fleſh &amp; blood, corrupt, full of guilt, full of deformity, having no beauty, no excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, no good in us, That God ſhould condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend ſo farre, as that upon being willing we ſhould have waters of life, as was ſaid before, he put no hard tearmes upon us, but ſaith, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will, let him take waters of life,</hi> that is, let him take me for his Portion let him take my Son, he ſhall be his Righteouſneſſe; Let him take my Spirit, it ſhall be his Sanctification; Let him take my word, it ſhall be his Light, Rule, and Comfort, and he ſhall be bleſſed here and hereafter: ô the infinite goodneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention of God towards poore wretches, ſuch as we are. Should you have ſeene <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his Glory and Royalty, to have ſtooped thus farre to a poore Blackamore, full of ſoares, and leperous, having no friend to ſpeake for her, as to ſay, Come manifeſt thy willingneſs to have me, I will have thee into my houſe, I will waſh thee, make thee my Queene, and make thee happie, had not this been wonderfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention in <hi>Solomon?</hi> Thus is it with God: We Blackamores that were in our blood, and full of ſoares, having no friend to plead for us,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:108127:127"/>but all againſt us, we have no good nor worth in us. Now <hi>Solomon</hi> the Prince of peace and life, he comes and ſaith, will you be ſav'd poore creatures? will you be waſht in my blood? will you goe along with me? will you be happy? come goe along with me, I will carry you to my Father, you ſhall ſit upon a Throne and live for ever, and Injoy God: ô the goodneſſe and condeſcention of God to poore ſinners!</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Here is matter of Comfort unto thoſe that doe deſire and thirſt after waters of life: The Doctrine ſaith, <hi>Thoſe that are willing ſhall have waters of life;</hi> and the text ſaith, <hi>Who ever will, let him take the waters of life:</hi> Waters of life are prepared, and reſerved for thoſe are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for thoſe are thirſty; therefore he ſaith in the 21 <hi>Revel:</hi> 6. <hi>If any man thirſt, he will give him of the Fountaine of the water of life freely.</hi> It may be you thirſt, and you are willing, but you ſtill want the waters of life:—is it ſo, waite patiently, you ſhall have waters of life in due time, and they are worth the waiting for, we can waite for a Bottle of wine, it may be, two or three houres, and for a ſhip of wines, many moneths, and will not you waite for waters of Life? Every promiſe is a tree of life, and the fruit is growing, and when it's ripe for you, you ſhall have it; every one is a bottle of wine, and when it pleaſes God, he will unſtop it, &amp; powre out the wine into your hearts: you ſhall have Chriſt, and the Spirit to ſeale you up to the day of Redemption; you ſhall have the blood of Chriſt to waſh you; you ſhall have God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and all that is good, therefore waite.</p>
            <p>Doe but Conſider a little of the Prodigall in
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:108127:127"/>the 15 of <hi>Luke: And when he came to himſelfe he ſaid, how many hyred ſervants of my Father have bread enough, but I periſh for hunger, I will ariſe and goe to my Father, and ſay,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And he aroſe and came to his Father:</hi> Now marke, here's the Prodigall, and what ſaith he? there's bread enough in my Fathers houſe, there's water of life in my Fathers houſe, here's none but ſtones, here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s none but ſwill for ſwine; <hi>in my Fathers houſe there's bread,</hi> he prizes it, I will goe eat of that bread, he chooſes it, and then he purſues it, <hi>Ile goe,</hi> ſaith he, and ſo goes and makes all the ſpeed he can to get to his Fathers houſe, and have it. And was he long without it? — See what followes, — <hi>And he aroſe and came to his Father; but while he was a great way off, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaw him, had Compaſſion, ran and fell on his neck and kiſſes him:</hi> the Son ſaith, <hi>Father I have ſinned,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the Father ſaith to his ſervants, Bring forth the beſt Robe, and put it on him, and put a Ring on his hand, and ſhooes on his feete, and bring hither the fatted Calfe and kill it, and let eat and be merry,</hi> (and the like:) — When you are willing thus to have water of life, the Father ſees you a farr off, and ſaith, there's one a coming to me, there is one coming for bread, for water of life, and what then? God will run and meete ſuch an one, he ſhall not be long without his water, he will kiſſe, and imbrace him, and give him water of life, he will give him wine, marrow, fattneſſe, and all that is good. Therefore be not you diſcouraged, but moove towards your Fathers houſe, towards the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, and it ſhall be brought forth unto you, and given you in abundance.</p>
